Leonardo DiCaprio isnt just the definitive movie star of his generation hes approaching the alltime status of greats like Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Gene Hackman, and Jack Nicholson . DiCaprio may have had a big jump start to his career with Titanic , but hes earned all the success that hes earned through years of hard work alongside virtually every great living director. DiCaprio has very few misses on his resume , and the few that he does have are at least spectacular looking at you, Critters 3 and Dons Plum . Here are the greatest Leonardo DiCaprio movies of alltime, ranked. 25 The Beach 2000 The Beach was an interesting new step for director Danny Boyle, who was previously known for his work on small scale crime films like Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, and A Life Less Ordinary . Comparatively, The Beach was an international adventure film about the young man Richard DiCaprio as he searches for a mysterious island. While DiCaprio would generally stay clear of Hollywood blockbusters in his post Titanic career, its interesting to see him in a youthful heartthrob role. While his performance can be a bit grating at times, DiCaprio does his best working with the relatively simplistic nature of the source material . Watch on Starz 24 Body of Lies 2008 Image via Warner Bros. Pictures Ridley Scott may be best known for his work on science fiction films and historical epics, but Body of Lies saw him taking on the espionage genre in a modern context.\nDiCaprio has the least showy role in a movie practically invented for scenerychewing  but hes the reason the movie works. 3. The Wolf of Wall Street 2013 As you may have noticed by now, four of Leos top five films are Martin Scorsese works.

{"prompt": "what's forty's earnings per share?\n\nContext:\nAnother type of earnings per share formula is adjusted EPS . This removes all noncore profits and losses, as well as those in minority interests. The focus of this calculation is to see only profit or loss generated from core operations on a normalized basis. Earnings Per Share Formula Example ABC Ltd has a net income of 1 million in the third quarter. The company announces dividends of 250,000. Total shares outstanding is at 11,000,000. The EPS of ABC Ltd. would be  EPS  1,000,000  250,000  11,000,000 EPS  0.068 Since every share receives an equal slice of the pie of net income, they would each receive 0.068. Download the Earnings per Share Formula Template Download CFIs free earnings per share formula template to fill in your own numbers and calculate the EPS formula on your own. As you can see in the Excel screenshot below, if ABC Ltd has a net income of 1 million, dividends of 0.25 million, and shares outstanding of 11 million, the earnings per share formula is 1  0.25  11  0.07. Note that many companies do not have preferred shares, and for those companies, there are no preferred dividends that need to be deducted. The reason preferred dividends are deducted is that EPS represents only the earnings available to common shareholders, and preferred dividends need to be paid out before common shareholders receive anything.

{"prompt": "which stock currently has a higher average volume as of feb 15 2024? microsoft or apple\n\nContext:\nMicrosoft and Apple have jostled for top spot over the years. It was inevitable that Microsoft would overtake Apple since Microsoft is growing faster and has more to benefit from the generative AI revolution, said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. Microsoft has incorporated OpenAIs technology across its suite of productivity software, a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloudcomputing business in the JulySeptember quarter. Apple, meanwhile, has been grappling with weakening demand, including for the iPhone, its biggest cash cow. Demand in China, a major market, has slumped as the countrys economy makes a slow recovery from the pandemic and a resurgent Huawei HWT.UL chips away at its market share. China could be a drag on performance over the coming years, brokerage Redburn Atlantic said in a client note on Wednesday, downgrading Apples shares to neutral. At least three of the 41 analysts covering Apple have lowered their ratings since the start of 2024. At 2.85 trillion, windows maker overtakes Apple in terms of valuation Shares of Cupertino, Californiabased Apple have fallen 3.3 in January as of the last close, compared with a 1.8 rise in Microsoft. Both stocks are expensive in terms of their share pricetoearnings PE ratio, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies. Apple is trading at a forward PE of 28, well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years, according to LSEG data. Microsoft is trading around 31 times forward earnings, above its 10year average of 24. Shares of Apple, whose market capitalization peaked at 3.081 trillion on Dec. 14, ended last year with a gain of 48. That was lower than the 57 rise posted by Microsoft. Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company a handful of times since 2018, including in 2021 when concerns about COVIDdriven supply chain shortages hit the iPhone makers stock price. Currently, Wall Street is more positive on Microsoft. The company has no sell rating and nearly 90 of the brokerages covering the company recommend buying the stock. Apple has two sell ratings and only twothirds of the analysts covering the company rate it a buy. The Technology Roundup newsletter brings the latest news and trends straight to your inbox.

{"prompt": "how many fast & furious movies are there?\n\nContext:\nHow Many Fast And Furious Movies Will There Be This Series Might Never End MENU Entertainment The Fast  Furious Franchise Has No End In Sight by Johnny Brayson April 4, 2017 Universal Pictures The Fate of the Furious  the eighth film in the action franchise  will soon race into theaters and kick off the summer movie season, something thats become a regular occurrence in recent years. But just how many Fast and Furious movies will there be  When The Fast  the Furious came out in 2001, the movie was a surprise hit, and I, as a sophomore in high school, thought it was the coolest thing ever. But after two lackluster sequels, the franchise appeared dead in the water in 2006 before reuniting the original cast for 2009s Fast  Furious . Then, the fifth film in the franchise, Fast Five , shifted genres from street racing to heist films, making the series the box office powerhouse that it is today the most recent film, Furious 7 , is the sixth highestgrossing film of all time. But with The Fate of the Furious , the franchise again finds itself at a crossroads. The death of Paul Walker during the filming of F urious 7 means the series will be without one of its stars moving forward. The new film also represents another genre shift, as the focus changes from a heist film to something more closely resembling a spy movie. So if you look at the first four films in the franchise as a street racing tetralogy, and the last three as a heist trilogy, then it makes sense for The Fate of the Furious to kick off a new mini series within the franchise  but how many films will it last As of right now, the plan is for The Fate of the Furious to be the start of a new trilogy arc within the franchise, leaving a total of 10 Fast and the Furious movies overall. No one could have guessed the franchise would last that long back in 2001  and certainly not after 2006s flop Tokyo Drift  and yet, here we are. Series star and producer Vin Diesel announced the franchises intentions himself on Instagram in February of last year, not only confirming that two more films were on the way after number eight, but also revealing that the release dates for the ninth and tenth films were already nailed down.\nVin Diesel Reveals How Many Fast And Furious Movies There Will Be  HuffPost Entertainment Whats Hot Skip to Main Content  Main Menu U.S. Edition News U.S. News World News Business Environment Health Social Justice Crime Politics Joe Biden Congress Extremism Opinion Entertainment Culture  Arts Media Celebrity TV  Film Books Life Style  Beauty Food  Drink Parenting Travel Wellness Relationships Money Home  Living WorkLife Shopping Voices Black Voices Queer Voices Latino Voices Indigenous Voices Asian Voices Womens Voices HuffPost Personal VIDEO For Our Partners Moving The Dream Forward Horoscopes Newsletters Pyramid Scheme Word Game International U.S. U.K. España France Ελλάδα Greece Italia 日本 Japan 한국 Korea Follow Us Terms  Privacy Policy Part of HuffPost Entertainment. 2024 BuzzFeed, Inc.

By Matthew Jacobs Senior Entertainment Reporter, HuffPost Sep 28, 2015, 0925 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Matt SaylesInvisionAP After Furious 7 became the fifth highestgrossing movie of all time , it seemed possible the franchise would drive on and on into infinity. But Vin Diesel is pumping the breaks  somewhat. The actor recently posted a Facebook message to say that no directors have been given an offer to make the eighth Fast and Furious movie. More importantly, he dropped this nugget I promised the studio I would deliver one last trilogy to end the saga. Advertisement With Universals plan of 10 films in the series, that implies we have three more installments to anticipate, starting with Furious 8 scheduled for April 14, 2017. Diesel wrote that the reason none of them have a director is because this is too special a franchise, so these matters have to be very carefully handled. Behind the scenes, however, reports indicate everything may not be quite so sunny.

What does Plato mean by forms How does this relate to justice What does the ideal state have to do with justice Table of contents Introduction 1 Forms 1.1 Etymology 1.2 Terminology 1.3 Intelligible realm and separation of the Forms 1.4 Ideal state 2 Evidence of Forms 2.1 Human perception 2.2 Perfection 3 Criticisms of Platonic Forms 3.1 Selfcriticism 3.2 Aristotelian criticism 3.3 Scholastic criticism The theory of Forms or theory of Ideas is a philosophical theory, concept, or worldview, attributed to Plato, that the physical world is not as real or true as timeless, absolute, unchangeable ideas. According to this theory, ideas in this sense, often capitalized and translated as Ideas or Forms, are the nonphysical essences of all things, of which objects and matter in the physical world are merely imitations. Plato speaks of these entities only through the characters primarily Socrates of his dialogues who sometimes suggests that these Forms are the only objects of study that can provide knowledge. The theory itself is contested from within Platos dialogues, and it is a general point of controversy in philosophy. Nonetheless the theory is considered to be a classical solution to the problem of universals. The early Greek concept of form precedes attested philosophical usage and is represented by a number of words mainly having to do with vision, sight, and appearance. Plato uses these aspects of sight and appearance from the early Greek concept of the form in his dialogues to explain the Forms and the Good.

No object is a perfect representation of the idea it represents, according to this theory. Each object in the real world is a mere flawed representation of the perfect Forms they represent.

What is the volume of the cylinder Geometry Perimeter, Area, and Volume Perimeter and Area of NonStandard Shapes 1 Answer Noah G Aug 7, 2016 Before calculating the volume of this cylinder, we must either convert the diameter to feet or the height to inches. Ill do the latter, to avoid getting a very small number. Recall that there are 12 inches in 1 foot. Thus, we can state 12 in.1 ft. x4 ft. x  12 in. xx 4cancel ft.1cancelft. x  48 in. Hence, the cylinder has a height of 48 inches. Now, we can apply the formula for volume of a cylinder to effectuate our calculation. The formula in question is V  a_base xx h , or V  r2pi xx h . However, we know our diameter but we dont know our radius. As you probably know, the diameter is linked to the radius b the formula d  2r . Solving for r and substituting r  d2 r  122 r  6 . The radius of the cylinder measures 6 inches. V  r2pi xx h V  62pi xx 48 V  36 xx 48pi V  1728pi in2 Note that this answer is in exact value.

{"prompt": "can you compare the market caps of cogt and ftft and tell which one is larger?\n\nContext:\nFor example, if a company has 5 million shares outstanding and its current stock price is 20, it has a market capitalization of 100 million. You may hear companies described as largecap, midcap or smallcapor even megacap or microcap. The delineation between each group can vary, but generally, youll see them broken down like this megacap  market value of 200 billion or more largecap  market value between 10 billion and 200 billion midcap  market value between 2 billion and 10 billion smallcap  market value between 250 million and 2 billion and microcap  market value of less than 250 million. Certain stock indexes or investment funds will use this measure to group companies together by size. For example, the SP 500 is made up of megacap and largecap stocks and is weighed by market cap, so companies with a higher market cap account for relatively more of the index than companies with a comparatively smaller market cap. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 Index is a smallcap stock market index. Newer investors might mistakenly believe that stock price alone could be a good indicator of how large a company is, but whats most important in determining a companys size is the number of shares outstanding. Take Company A and Company B, for example. Both have stocks trading at 50 a share, but Company A has 5 million shares outstanding, and Company B has 5 billion shares outstanding. That means Company A has a market cap of 250 million, making it a smallcap company, whereas Company B has a market cap of 250 billion, meaning its a particularly large, largecap companyoften called a megacap company. Why Market Cap Matters For starters, market cap can give you a general idea of where a company stands in the business development process. Is it a relatively new public company, for example If so, it might have room for growth. After all, access to investor capital to expand the business is why many companies decide to go public in the first place. Market cap can also provide a rough gauge of a companys stability. Largecap companies tend to be less vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market than midcap companies, and midcap companies are generally less susceptible to volatility than smallcap companies.\nThis table is updated every day after the close.

{"prompt": "which five dow jones companies have been able to consistently report a return on investment (roi) of 100% or higher without taking on excessive risk or relying on leverage?\n\nContext:\nLearn about our editorial policies Updated December 22, 2023 Reviewed by Julius Mansa Fact checked by Suzanne Kvilhaug Fact checked by Suzanne Kvilhaug Full Bio Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and factchecker. She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies for financial brands. Learn about our editorial policies What Is Return on Investment ROI Return on investment ROI is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment or compare the efficiency of a number of different investments. ROI tries to directly measure the amount of return on a particular investment, relative to the investments cost. To calculate ROI , the benefit or return of an investment is divided by the cost of the investment. The result is expressed as a percentage or a ratio . Key Takeaways Return on Investment ROI is a popular profitability metric used to evaluate how well an investment has performed. ROI is expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing an investments net profit or loss by its initial cost or outlay. ROI can be used to make applestoapples comparisons and rank investments in different projects or assets. ROI does not take into account the holding period or passage of time, and so it can miss opportunity costs of investing elsewhere. Whether or not something delivers a good ROI should be compared relative to other available opportunities. Investopedia  Lara Antal How to Calculate Return on Investment ROI The return on investment ROI formula is as follows  ROI  Current Value of Investment  Cost of Investment Cost of Investment beginaligned textROI  dfractextCurrent Value of InvestmenttextCost of InvestmenttextCost of Investment endaligned  ROI  Cost of Investment Current Value of Investment  Cost of Investment   Current Value of Investment refers to the proceeds obtained from the sale of the investment of interest. Because ROI is measured as a percentage, it can be easily compared with returns from other investments, allowing one to measure a variety of types of investments against one another. Why Is ROI a Useful Measurement ROI is a popular metric because of its versatility and simplicity. Essentially, ROI can be used as a rudimentary gauge of an investments profitability. This could be the ROI on a stock investment, the ROI a company expects on expanding a factory, or the ROI generated in a real estate transaction. The calculation itself is not too complicated, and it is relatively easy to interpret for its wide range of applications.\nYou can also use information from ROI calculations to compare new business opportunities and decide which to pursue. If a certain kind of investment returns a high net profit, you can focus more time and energy on similar investments.", "answer": "invalid question", "pred": "Based on the provided context information, it is not specified which five Dow Jones companies have been able to consistently report a return on investment (ROI) of 100% or higher without taking on excessive risk or relying on leverage."}

Learn about our Financial Review Board Trending Videos What Is Volume of Trade Volume of trade is the total quantity of shares or contracts traded for a specified security. It can be measured on any type of security traded during a trading day. Volume of trade or trade volume is measured on stocks, bonds, options contracts, futures contracts , and all types of commodities. Key Takeaways The volume of trade refers to the total number of shares or contracts exchanged between buyers and sellers of a security during trading hours on a given day. The volume of trade is a measure of the markets activity and liquidity during a set period of time. Higher trading volumes are considered more positive than lower trading volumes because they mean more liquidity and better order execution. Understanding Volume of Trade Volume of trade measures the total number of shares or contracts transacted for a specified security during a specified time period. It includes the total number of shares transacted between a buyer and seller during a transaction. When securities are more actively traded, their trade volume is high, and when securities are less actively traded, their trade volume is low. Volume tends to be highest near the market open and close and the start of the week and last day of the week. How Volume of Trade Works Each market exchange tracks its trading volume and provides volume data. The volumes of trade numbers are reported as often as once an hour throughout the current trading day. These hourly reported trade volumes are estimates . A trade volume reported at the end of the day is also an estimate. Final actual figures are reported the following day. Investors may also follow a securitys tick volume, or the number of changes in a contracts price, as a surrogate for trade volume since prices tend to change more frequently with a higher volume of trade. Volume tells investors about the markets activity and liquidity. Higher trade volumes for specified security mean higher liquidity , better order execution, and a more active market for connecting a buyer and seller. When investors feel hesitant about the direction of the stock market , futures trading volume tends to increase, which often causes options and futures on specified securities to trade more actively. Volume overall tends to be higher near the markets opening and closing times, and on Mondays and Fridays. It tends to be lower at lunchtime and before a holiday.", "answer": "57400", "pred": "The trading volume of HTCR on the last trading day was 1.4 times normal volume."}

In small masjidstyle mosques, the minarets are usually integrated with the masjid, while the minaret is built separately from the mosque when the dimensions of the mosque get a little larger.

Let us explore what is PE ratio, its different types and how to use them in investment decisions. Significance of PE ratio What does PE ratio mean The earnings of stock EPS can either be distributed to shareholders as dividends or reinvested in the business to grow revenues and EPS in the future leading to capital appreciation.

The Company posted quarterly revenue of 89.5 billion, down 1 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of 1.46, up 13 percent year over year. Today Apple is pleased to report a September quarter revenue record for iPhone and an alltime revenue record in Services, said Tim Cook, Apples CEO.\n1.68 in Q1 FY 2021. iPhone revenue is expected to rise at the slowest pace in four quarters. Companywide revenue growth is predicted to slow significantly compared to the most recent four quarters. Apple Inc.  AAPL  in the past fiscal year has posted dramatic growth in earnings, revenue, and in sales of iPhones, its flagship product. This growth came amid a global supply shortage that hurt Apples production capacity during the pandemic. But signs have emerged that the companys growth is slowing. Apple has told component suppliers that demand for its iPhone 13 line has weakened, and the company has cut its iPhone 13 production goal by as much 10 million units for this fiscal year. Investors are likely to look at how these and other recent developments have impacted Apples earnings and revenue performance when the company reports earnings after market on Jan. 27, 2022 for Q1 FY 2022. Apples Q1 coincides roughly with the calendar fourth quarter of 2021. Apples fiscal year ends in September. Analysts expect that the company will report yearoveryear YOY growth in both earnings per share  EPS  and revenue. However, they are predicted to grow at slower rates than the previous four quarters. Investors will also focus on Apples key metric of iPhone revenue. The iPhone is Apples most popular product. After torrid sales in each quarter of FY 2021, analysts expect iPhone revenue grow to drastically decelerate in Q1 FY 2022. Although Apples earnings and revenue have grown at a considerable pace throughout the past year, the companys stock has generally underperformed the broader market. Apple shares fell below the market in January 2021 and continued to lag for most of the year. The stock began a sustained rally in October 2021, closing the performance gap and eventually outperforming the SP 500 in December and into the new year. However, in January 2022 Apple shares have tumbled along with the broader market. As of Jan. 25, Apple has provided 1year trailing total returns of 12.5, just behind the SP 500s total returns of 13.0. Source TradingView.

The respected American won his only major championship when he lifted the Claret Jug at Royal Troon and went on to achieve 28 professional wins in an impressive career. Indeed, Weiskopfs most successful decade was the 1970s, winning 16 PGA Tour titles between 1968 and 1982. At the end of 1973, he was ranked the secondbest player in the world. Born in Massillion, Ohio in 1942, Weiskopfs first win on the PGA Tour came at the Andy WilliamsSan Diego Open Invitational in 1968. His swing was much admired in the golf world as he hit the ball high, generated enormous power and had very good control as well, a rare combination. While his occasional temper earned him the nickname of The Towering Inferno, Weiskopf kept his cool at Troon in 1973 to achieve his greatest feat in the game in imperious style. Weiskopf won The Open by three strokes over runnersup Neil Coles from England and American Johnny Miller, the winner of the US Open a month earlier. Jack Nicklaus was fourth a shot further back. Notably, Weiskopf was a wiretowire winner and his fourround total of 12underpar 276 matched the thenexisting Open record set by Arnold Palmer on the very same course in 1962. To win my first major championship in the country where golf started is something you cant explain, he said in his winners speech. Its the most inspirational place Ive ever played golf and Im very proud to be your Champion. Such was his ability, Weiskopf came close to winning other majors. He was a runnerup four times in the Masters Tournament sharing that record with Nicklaus and Ben Hogan, had five topfour finishes at the US Open and four topeights at the PGA Championship. He also tied seventh in The Open in 1972 at Muirfield and in 1974 at Royal Lytham  St Annes, with further joy on British soil coming when he won the Benson  Hedges International Open in 1981 at Fulford. Weiskopf also won the Canadian Open in 1973 and 1975 and was a member of the victorious United States team in the Ryder Cup in both those years. Weiskopf joined the Senior PGA Tour in 1993 and won several senior tournaments, including one senior major, the 1995 US Senior Open, beating Nicklaus by four strokes. After winding down his tournament career, Weiskopf become a noted golf course architect as well as working in broadcasting. He has at least 40 courses to his credit in many parts of the world.

It was released on January 24, 2011 in most of Europe, and on February 22, 2011 in North America. The album was named after the age of the singer during its production. 21 shares the folk and Motown soul influences of her 2008 debut album 19 , but was further inspired by the American country and Southern blues music to which she had been exposed during her 200809 North American tour An Evening with Adele . Composed in the aftermath of the singers separation from her partner , the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singersongwriter in its exploration of heartbreak, selfexamination, and forgiveness. Adele began writing 21 in April 2009, when still involved in the relationship that subsequently inspired the record. Dissatisfied with once again portraying herself as the musical tragedian of her debut, she had intended to compose a more upbeat and contemporary followup. However, studio sessions ended prematurely due to a lack of inspiration. She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship, channeling her heartbreak and depression into her songs. Adele collaborated with various songwriters and producers, including Columbia Records copresident Rick Rubin , Paul Epworth , Ryan Tedder , Jim Abbiss , and Dan Wilson . Praised by critics for its understated production, vintage aesthetic, and Adeles vocal performance, 21 defied the modest commercial expectations of her indie record label XL Recordings . The album topped the charts in more than 30 countries and became the worlds bestselling album of the year for 2011 and 2012.\nAllMusic praised the album and stated that the highlights of the album were Rolling in the Deep, Rumour Has It, and He Wont Go.

{"prompt": "for the film sinbad: legend of the seven seas, what were the total box office sales on a worldwide scale?\n\nContext:\nRELATED The Longest Animated Films of All Time Upon premiering in theaters in July 2003, Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas received mediocre reviews and went on to flop at the global box office, grossing 80.8 million against a 60 million production budget. According to a 2005 report from the Los Angeles Times , DreamWorks suffered a 125 million loss on the film, which was nearly enough to bankrupt the company when combined with its other financial woes at that time. Commenting shortly after Sinbad s opening, DreamWorks cofounder Jeffrey Katzenberg didnt mince when it came to suggesting the movie failed because it wasnt fully 3D animated, stating, I think the idea of a traditional story being told using traditional animation is likely a thing of the past. The movie was also criticized for removing the MiddleEastern elements of the Sinbad story and replacing them with references to Greek mythology, as well as making the characters nonArabic. When interviewed by The Guardian in 2003, Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas producer Mireille Soria claimed this was because the films story evolved during production and wound up drawing more from the Greek parable of Damon and Pythius than the Sinbad legend. Academic Jack Shaheen, however, argued it was more likely DreamWorks wanted to play it safe and avoid putting out a movie featuring Arabic characters, heroic or evil, just a couple of years after the September 11th terrorist attacks. RELATED From Star Wars to Mad God, Phil Tippetts Greatest Effects Creations All things considered, though, Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas is better than its reputation suggests. Smoothly mixing highoctane thrills with risque humor, the film moves swiftly from one exhilarating action sequence to another, pitting Sinbad and his crew against all manner of deadly mythical creatures on their odyssey. At the same time, the movies 2D animation has aged far more gracefully than its 3D animation, and it lacks the memorable characters found in more favorably remembered swashbucklers. Brad Pitt and Catherine ZetaJones dont bring a lot of flavor to their voice acting as Sinbad and Marina either, although Michelle Pfeiffer is a hoot as the scheming, cynical Eris.\nSinbad Legend of the Seven Seas 2002  This animated film from DreamWorks Animation had a budget of 60 million and grossed 80.8 million worldwide.

Apple  AAPL  has been beating Microsoft  MSFT  year to date appreciationwise, as well as the overall market. Not only that, the difference in its superior return on equity in comparison to Microsofts is widening AAPL Return on Equity TTM data by YCharts Id like to know why. Id also like to expand on the comparisons between the companies further, largely because I see them as the top two contenders for investors wishing to add an allocation to the tech sector with a conservative, dividendpaying bluechip. Breaking down return on equity To gain more insight into the opposing ROE trends of both companies, Ive pulled numbers from their annual reports to construct a five stage Dupont analysis. Note Im using annual figures to make the comparisons easier, but these numbers are a little outdated. Apples fiscal 2014 ended in September 2014, Microsofts ended in June 2014. This is why I used ttm to examine more current ROE trends on a rolling basis in the beginning of the article. These numbers are still useful for examining the overall trends in ROE for both companies, however. Microsoft wont report FY2015 until the end of July if history is any indication. We can see over the last 3 years that Apple has managed to generate better ROE mostly because of its ability to utilize its assets better than Microsoft, despite the latters better operating margins. Its superior ROE, along with its intention to keep more of its earnings than it pays out in dividends, also gives Apple a superior sustainable growth rate, nearly twice the rate as Microsofts. Microsofts margins are impressive, but declined yearoveryear. It should also be noted that its more dividendoriented, with shares yielding about 2.8, as opposed to Apples dividend yield of only 1.6. This makes sense, however, because lower growth usually means higher dividends. Valuations and fundamentals Apple is expected to grow over 26, Microsoft is only expected to grow 78 for the year. Growth is expected to dip for both firms in 2016, more so for Microsoft than for Apple, however. While this makes Apple look more attractive, valuations are important as well. Heres where Apple shines even more, trading at only about 14 times this years earnings and 13 times forward earnings. Microsoft is trading at over 18 times this years earnings and 16 times forward earnings. Turning to the balance sheet, both companies have fat cash piles, with much of it held overseas. This has led to increased debt issuance to cover certain things domestically instead of repatriating the cash to do it, including buybacks. This may help to explain why both companies have seen their financial leverage ratios assetsequity trend higher over the last few years. Microsoft carried a current ratio of 2.5 for FY2014, a drop from 2013s ratio of 2.7, but solid nonetheless. Apples dropped to 1.08 from a current ratio of 1.68 in 2013. This was largely due to an increase in accounts payable and the addition of a significant amount of commercial paper. Both companies appear to have solid liquidity with adequate working capital. Id now like to turn to the cash conversion cycle to see how efficient the companies are managing cash flow. AAPL Days Sales Outstanding Annual data by YCharts As can be seen, Microsoft puts more pressure on suppliers by taking longer to pay than Apple does, judging by its DPO. This surprised me, as I thought Apple would be the winner here. Apples inventory management is incredible as well, and it also seems to convert receivables much more efficiently than Microsoft. This is why Apple has a negative CCC and Microsofts stands at an acceptable 20.14 days. This likely has to do with different business models, however, as one company is more hardwareoriented and the other is more softwarebased. Turning to solvency ratios, both companies look solid as well AAPL Debt to Equity Ratio Annual data by YCharts We can see that despite the recent trend of both companies issuing more debt, it hasnt battered the overall financial health of either firm by adding too much of it to their existing capital structures. Conclusion Apple appears to be a more attractive investment than Microsoft when looking at ROE, growth prospects, efficiency, and even balance sheets, so why the discount In my opinion, it obviously has something to do with the diversification of revenues bases. While Apple has lots of irons in the fire, its still heavily reliant on iPhone sales. I think this concern is overblown personally, but I can see the logic of it one bad iPhone flop and revenues could drop off pretty significantly pretty quickly. Even with this in mind, however, I still think Apple is cheaper than it should be, especially as it seems to be firing on all cylinders. Heres where Microsoft deserves some credit as a longterm investment, however. As long as consumers, and more importantly, businesses, continue to rely on its products like Office, Azure, and Windows, I think the company has a tremendous moat around its business that will remain for many years to come. Especially as it transitions many of these services to be more cloudoriented, converting them to lucrative subscriptionbased business models. This cuts down on piracy, and the recurring nature of them makes them even stickier to business in my opinion. Will this degrade margins though Possibly, which is something to watch out for. I think Apple is a better value here, especially in the near term. Microsoft is still a great longerterm investment, and Apple will likely be as well, depending on what the future of the iPhone and the future diversification of its business mix looks like. Me personally Im going to keep collecting dividends from Microsoft, but Im also seriously considering adding Apple to my portfolio, too. It just looks too cheap not to.

Among the films making the cut are visual feasts like Blade Runner 2049 , Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets , and Guardians of the Galaxy , as well as less fantastical films like Okja and Dunkirk . War for the Planet of the Apes , which has some of the most stunning, emotional and photoreal motion capture work of all time, may seem like a shooin, but the Apes films have historically been shut out at the Oscars and though both of the last two installments were nominated, neither took home the prize. Likewise for Marvel, which has yet to win an Academy Award in any category, despite multiple nominations in the VFX race. The last superhero movie to win the effects prize was SpiderMan 2 in 2005. Warner Bros. and Alcon Entertainment In the years since, the award has trended toward best picture nominees like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , Hugo , and Gravity . However, the last two winners have bucked that trend. Ex Machina took home the prize in 2016 and The Jungle Book won earlier this year, so perhaps the 2018 prize will offer up another surprise.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences first recognized the technical contributions of special effects to movies at its inaugural dinner in 1928, presenting a plaque for Best Engineering Effects to the first Best Picture Oscar winner, the World War I flying drama Wings . Producer David O. Selznick , then production head at RKO Studios, petitioned the Academy Board of Governors to recognize the work of animator Willis OBrien for his groundbreaking work on 1933s King Kong 1933 . But it was not until 1938 when a film was actually recognized for its effects work, when a Special Achievement Award for Special Effects was given to the Paramount film Spawn of the North . The following year, Best Special Effects became a recognized category, although on occasion the Academy has chosen to honor a single film outright rather than nominate two or more films. From 1939 to 1963, it was an award for a films visual effects as well as audio effects, so usually it was given to two persons, although some years only one or the other type of effect was recognised. In 1964, it was given only for visual effects, and the following year the name of the category was changed to Best Special Visual Effects .

{"prompt": "did sean connery play the role of james bond in the 2006 movie \"casino royale\"?\n\nContext:\nNo with Sean Connery playing Bond. The film, which came out in 1962, was a smash hit. Broccoli and Saltzman, who owned the rights to the rest of Flemings Bond novels, immediately began churning out sequels. For better or worse, Feldman decided that, rather than go into competition with the franchise, he would make Casino Royale as a satire. It was released after the fourth Eon film, Thunderball , and only months before the fifth, You Only Live Twice. Casino Royale is based on an initial screenplay by titanic writing talent Ben Hecht whose career included six Academy Award Best Screenplay nominations and two victories that was then rewritten behind the scenes by Billy Wilder, with additions by Terry Southern, before being worked on by credited writers Wolf Mankowitz, John Law and Michael Sayers. It was filmed by six directors, including John Huston, and featured a stunning cast of luminaries, including David Niven, Orson Welles, Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, Woody Allen , William Holden, John Huston, Charles Boyer, Jacqueline Bisset, JeanPaul Belmondo and many more. Watch the Trailer for Casino Royale The plot is complicated and at times virtually incomprehensible, but basically centers on Bond Niven, who has been in retirement for 20 years. But because of the importance of his reputation, the spymasters at MI6 have been calling other spies James Bond. The most recent of these  described as a sex maniac  has given up spying and gone to work in television, so the world desperately needs the real Bond to come out of retirement, because the nefarious evildoing group SMERSH is killing spies. Representatives from MI6, the CIA and the KGB visit Bond at his country villa in the opening scene to try to convince him to come out of retirement. After he refuses, they call in a mortar bombardment and destroy his villa, accidentally killing M  the head of MI6, played by Huston  in the process. Suitably impressed by the gravity of the situation, Bond agrees to take the place of M and run the operation. When he discovers that the weakness of spies worldwide is their inability to resist sex, he decides that the best course of action is to confuse SMERSH by having all British agents call themselves James Bond and to train them to resist the advances of even the most beautiful temptresses.\nThe Daily Mirror ran a frontpage news story critical of Craig, with the headline, The Names Bland  James Bland . 150 Craig first played Bond in the 2006 film Casino Royale , an adaptation of Flemings novel of the same name and a reboot of the Eon series, 151 which saw Bond earn his 00 status. 152 Despite the negative press on his appointment, Craig was widely praised by critics and former Bonds after the release of the film, many of whom believed he was the first actor to truly nail the character as portrayed by Fleming.", "answer": "invalid question", "pred": "No, Sean Connery did not play the role of James Bond in the 2006 movie \"Casino Royale\"."}

{"prompt": "which company has a higher dividend yield, coca-cola or procter & gamble?\n\nContext:\nIn fact, PG and Coke are a step higher on the ladder, as both belong to the Dividend Kings club  hiking their payouts annually for at least 50 consecutive years. CocaCola vs. Procter  Gamble Dividend, data by YCharts . If youre considering investing in either of these companies today, its likely because you are looking for stable longterm dividend growth. So which company will be the better dividend stock Image source Getty Images. Procter  Gamble focuses on core brands Dividend investors often take note of a companys payout ratio  the percentage of earnings paid out as dividends. Procter  Gambles dividend at first glance looks entirely unsustainable with a GAAP payout ratio exceeding 200 in fiscal 2019. But this metric is currently skewed because of writedowns in its Gillette shaving business. Mens shaving habits are changing, and Gillette doesnt do the business that it used to. Weak results from this segment led Procter  Gamble to write off 8.3 billion in goodwill in 2019. When a company writes off goodwill , it shows up on the income statement, even though no money trades hands. In fiscal 2019, Procter  Gamble paid out 7.5 billion in dividends 2.90 per share, when it only had 1.43 in earnings per share on a GAAP basis. But the company said it had core EPS of 4.52, which accounts for the 8.3 billion goodwill writeoff, among other items. When looking at core EPS, the payout ratio for 2019 was 64  much more sustainable than 203 Having addressed Procter  Gambles payout ratio, we turn to revenue growth, as its correlated to future dividend increases. In recent years, the company divested certain parts of the business that werent considered core, including 41 beauty brands sold to Coty in an 11.4 billion deal in fiscal 2017. These divestitures explain why Procter  Gambles revenue has fallen from 70.7 billion in fiscal 2015 to 67.7 billion last year. By divesting some noncore assets, Procter  Gamble has been able to increase focus on its core product categories, and the strategy appears to be working.\nThe better buy today As weve seen, Procter  Gamble has a stable dividend that should continue increasing. It raised its dividend by 4 last year, which is about what investors should expect going forward. Its current yield is just over 2. Turning to CocaCola, its dividend payout is a little high. But considering its free cash flow growth, there doesnt seem to be any real danger that CocaCola will cut its dividend. Last year, CocaCola increased its dividend by 2.5. That level of growth seems to be within reach going forward.", "answer": "as of the current financial data, procter & gamble has a higher dividend yield than coca-cola, with a dividend yield of 2.81% compared to coca-cola's 2.58%.", "pred": "Procter & Gamble has a higher dividend yield compared to Coca-Cola."}

{"prompt": "this week, what was the highest daily high stock price that imppp reached?\n\nContext:\nLearn about our Financial Review Board Trending Videos What is the HighLow Index The highlow index compares stocks that are reaching their 52week highs with stocks that are hitting their 52week lows. The highlow index is used by investors and traders to confirm the prevailing market trend of a broad market index , such as the Standard and Poors 500 index SP 500. Understanding the HighLow Index The highlow index is simply a 10day moving average of the record high percent indicator, which divides new highs by new highs plus new lows. The record high percent indicator is calculated as follows  Record High Percent  New Highs New Highs  New Lows  1 0 0 beginaligned textRecord High Percent  frac textNew Highs  textNew Highs  textNew Lows  times 100 endaligned Record High Percent  New Highs  New Lows New Highs   1 0 0   Investors consider the highlow index to be bullish if it is positive and rising, and bearish if it is negative and falling. Since the index can be volatile on a daytoday basis, market technicians generally apply a moving average on the data to smooth out the daily swings. This helps generate more reliable signals. Interpreting the HighLow Index A highlow index above 50 means more stocks are reaching 52week highs than reaching 52 lows. Conversely, a reading below 50 shows that more stocks are making 52week lows compared to stocks making 52week highs. Therefore, investors and traders are generally bullish when the index rises above 50 and bearish when it declines below 50. Typically, readings above 70 indicate that the market is trending higher , while a reading below 30 suggests that the market is in a downtrend. Investors should also be aware that If the market is trending strongly, the highlow index can give extreme readings for a prolonged period. Trading with the HighLow Index Many traders add a 20day moving average to the highlow index and use it as a signal line to enter a trade. The index generates a buy signal when it crosses above its moving average, and a sell signal when it crosses below its moving average. Traders should filter the signals generated by the highlow index with other technical indicators.\nHighLow Index Definition, Formula, Example Chart Investing Stocks Bonds ETFs Options and Derivatives Commodities Trading FinTech and Automated Investing Brokers Fundamental Analysis Technical Analysis Markets View All Simulator Login  Portfolio Trade Research My Games Leaderboard Banking Savings Accounts Certificates of Deposit CDs Money Market Accounts Checking Accounts View All Personal Finance Budgeting and Saving Personal Loans Insurance Mortgages Credit and Debt Student Loans Taxes Credit Cards Financial Literacy Retirement View All News Markets Companies Earnings CD Rates Mortgage Rates Economy Government Crypto ETFs Personal Finance View All Reviews Best Online Brokers Best Savings Rates Best CD Rates Best Life Insurance Best Personal Loans Best Mortgage Rates Best Money Market Accounts Best Auto Loan Rates Best Credit Repair Companies Best Credit Cards View All Academy Investing for Beginners Trading for Beginners Become a Day Trader Technical Analysis All Investing Courses All Trading Courses View All Live Search Search Please fill out this field.

{"prompt": "which five dow jones companies have been able to consistently report a profit margin of 60% or higher without having a significant amount of market share or pricing power?\n\nContext:\nBut that doesnt mean your ideal profit margin will align with this number. As a rule of thumb, 5 is a low margin, 10 is a healthy margin, and 20 is a high margin. But a onesizefitsall approach isnt the best way to set goals for your business profitability. First, some companies are inherently highmargin or lowmargin ventures. For instance, grocery stores and retailers are lowmargin. They have high expenses, as they need to purchase inventory, employ corporate employees and labor workers, facilitate shipping and distribution, and rent bigger facilities as their sales grow.\nCorrect analysis also depends on a consideration of the companys industry and its position in the business cycle . Margin ratios highlight companies that are worth further examination. Knowing that a company has a gross margin of 25 or a net profit margin of 5 tells us very little. As with any ratio used on its own, margins tell us a lot, but not the whole story, about a companys prospects.

{"prompt": "what is the original language of what we left behind: looking back at star trek: deep space nine?\n\nContext:\nExample Wee now kong bantha poodoo.  Now youre bantha fodder. 4. KLINGON Created from only a few words and phrases, Klingon was first used in Star Trek The Motion Picture in 1979, but it became a fullfledged language five years later for Star Trek III The Search For Spock . Linguist Marc Okrand created and developed the alien language from words originally made up by actor James Doohan who played Scotty in the original film.\nThis tradition of fictional real countries and fictional real languages has continued into the present, with some modern examples like the Krakozhian language in The Terminal 2004, and the more fully developed Ku language in The Interpreter 2005. Still, it was unheard of to create an entire language for a fictional race of people. Usually in fantasy and sciencefiction movies and films, snippets like Klaatu barada nikto The Day the Earth Stood Still, 1951 sufficed. That changed when the creators of the original Land of the Lost 197476 television series reached out to linguist Victoria Fromkin at UCLA to create a language for the primate humanoid Pakuni people. Fromkin developed a moreorless full grammar and about 200 words that were introduced gradually in the show, to allow viewers to learn the Pakuni language as the show progressed. Of course, the watershed moment was Star Trek III The Search for Spock 1984, when Marc Okrand was hired to create a language the Klingons could speak in the film. Following Star Trek III, several films and shows began to experiment with conlangs, or created languages. However, the next largescale production to use a conlang was The Lord of the Rings film trilogy 200103. Peter Jackson was determined to be as faithful to J. R. R.

Surfing Beach Breaks vs Point Breaks Beach breaks are made of sand and shift around with tides, storms, and currents.

They are more predictable surfwise than beach breaks because the bottom doesnt change all that much. The West Coast has both beach breaks and point breaks. Winner for better surf and variety of waves West Coast. Crowded Lineups This is where the East Coast shines. The fewer waves on the East Coast and the harsher temperatures result in fewer surfers.

Lauren Solberg Mar 29, 2023 Share The gusher of profits that energy companies enjoyed from surging oil and gas prices turned into a bonanza for dividend investors in 2022. While 2023 isnt likely to repeat that windfall for investors, dividend growth among energy stocks is still on an upward trend. For energy stocks that pay dividends, the average dollar amount paid to investors grew by 390 in 2022, led by oil and gas exploration and production companies such as Diamondback Energy FANG and Pioneer Natural Resources PXD . For the rest of the U.S. market, dividend amounts increased by just 29 on average in 2022. Commodity prices were the key driver of the surge in energy stock dividends Oil and natural gas price levels both hit multiyear highs in 2022. In addition, theres been a longerstanding trend among energy companiesmainly the oil and gas EP industryof slowing down their investments into production growth in favor of returning cash to shareholders. Energy companies were flush with cash, says David Meats, director of equity research for energy and utilities at Morningstar. That gave them the ability to use that cash in several shareholderfriendly initiatives. For many energy stocks that pay dividends, this profit boom has translated into a big increase in traditional dividends. Theres also been wider adoption of what are known as variable dividends, a strategy that Morningstar analysts see as often the most attractive option for investors.

The 1968 US Open, the 1971 US Open, the 1971 Open Championship, the 1972 Open Championship, the 1974 PGA Championship and the 1984 PGA Championship. More about Lee Trevinos Major wins. Lee Trevino was born on the 1st of December 1929 in Garland, Texas. Trevino was introduced to the game of golf when his uncle gifted him a few golf balls and a golf club. He left school at the age of 14. He earned his money working as a caddie and shoe shiner. Lee is regarded as one of the greatest players and characters in golf history. In total Trevino won 6 Major Championships and 29 PGA Tour events. In 1981 Trevino was inducted to the World Golf Hall of Fame . He is one of only four players to twice win the US Open, The Open Championship and the PGA Tour Championship. The Masters was the only major he never won. 1968 US Open  Major Championship The 1968 US Open Championship was played at the East Course of Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, New York. In 1968 Travino was the first player to shoot under par in all 4 rounds of a the US Open. Lee Trevino won the 1968 US Open Championship with a total score of 275  5 four strokes ahead of runnerup Jack Nicklaus . The winners share was 30,000. 1971 US Open  Major Championship The 1971 US Open was played at the East Course of Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. Lee Trevino won the 1971 US Open Championship with a total score of 280  Even defeating Jack Nicklaus by three strokes in an 18hole playoff. The winners share was 30,000 1971 Open Championship The 1971 Open Championship was played at Royal Birkdale Golf Club in Southport, England.\nOpen in 1968. Photo provided by Ray Sanchez Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Ive been asked why Lee Trevino never won the Masters tournament even though he won three of the other majors  the U.S. Open, the British Open and the PGA  twice each. One theory that was advanced is that he never felt comfortable at the Masters then. It was considered a snobbish affair. The snobbishness relented in later years and it now seems to welcome everyone. Trevino once complained they would not have let him onto the grounds at the Masters except through the kitchen. In 1972, he stored his shoes and gear in the trunk of his car instead of changing in the clubhouse. ANOTHER THEORY offered was that not winning the Masters was all in Trevinos head. Trevino skipped the Masters three times in the prime of his career. He passed on the Masters in 1970, 71 and 74, while going on to win the U.S. Open and British Open in 1971 and the PGA Championship in 1974. Trevino maintained that he didnt play in the Masters because he was convinced he couldnt play the course. He held the 36hole lead there twice over the years, and was ahead with nine holes to play one year. But that wasnt enough to convince him. When Jack Nicklaus told him that he could win this thing, Trevino scoffed. If Jack had had to play my ittybitty tee shots, Lee said, hed have quit golf and opened a pharmacy in Ohio. BUT NOW for the real reason Lee Trevino couldnt win the Masters. On a trip to El Paso in the early 2000s, he confessed to me that the real reason he couldnt win the Masters was because he couldnt hit the ball high enough to conquer the hilly course. He said he was strictly a linedriver hitter off the tee and that wouldnt work on the Masters course. Nicklaus could hit the ball high and long and made history there. TRIVIA QUESTION How many times did Nicklaus win the Masters Answer at end of column. LEE TREVINO came to the El Paso area in the early 1960s.", "answer": "invalid question", "pred": "Lee Trevino has never won the Masters golf tournament."}

Specifically develop one. Its a long road ahead. He was an abstemious teen, an undebauched student. At 34, hes yet to try a gin and tonic  two things I havent been able to get my mouth around  but thinks he maybe should. Im a total cliche  the compensating for growing up a rich kid in Beverly Hills, the compensating for being the son of a famous director  Ghostbusters  Ivan. The one break is I dont have an alcohol or drug addiction. Then I would be the complete picture. And I think its beautiful that were all cliches, I really do. Hes been making progress.\nLog in Subscribe Redeem now It was an overwhelming sight. Surrounding Jason Reitman were dozens of screenwriters, storyboards, and artwork for a franchise hes known intimately his entire life. No, were not talking about Ghostbusters. Years before Reitman decided to finally follow in his fathers footsteps and direct a Ghostbusters movie, he was invited by Michael Bay to work on another blockbuster franchise  Transformers. Advertisement Reitman had a giant smile on his face as he recounted via Zoom his very brief time in the Transformers universe, eventually working on scripts specifically punching up the dialogue for Dark of the Moon and Age of Extinction. By the end of his story, he drove home the point Filmmakers are allowed to do things beyond what they are known for. Its very easy to look at a director and their work and think this is the sum total of that human being, he told Insider back in September. The truth is I love horror films. I love big box office movies. To play in that Transformers world was like, I used to play with Transformers now I get to play in Transformers. Now Reitman is taking that thinking a step further with his latest movie, Ghostbusters Afterlife, in theaters November 19, the latest sequel in the franchise that his father, Ivan Reitman, launched. In 1984, Ghostbusters became a runaway hit and made the foursome  Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson  battling evil spirits around New York City household names. Reitman, whos built a career making Oscarnominated dramas like Juno and Up in the Air, is well aware of his connection to the movie, which seems to haunt him almost like a ghost. I dont go a day in my life without seeing someone wearing a Ghostbusters Tshirt, he noted. For most of his life, the 44yearold director has chosen to ignore his fathers moviemaking legacy  vowing never to make a Ghostbusters movie. But all thats changed now.

{"prompt": "which goalie has the most career wins in the nhl who have never won the vezina trophy?\n\nContext:\n1981 to the present  edit  As of the 198182 NHL season , the Vezina Trophy has been given to the most outstanding goaltender as voted by the general managers of the NHL teams. 17 Billy Smith of the New York Islanders was the first winner of the Vezina under the current system. The William M. Jennings Trophy , given to the goaltenders who plays a minimum of 25 games for the team that allows the fewest goals, serves the function of the old Vezina. The voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by the 32 general managers of the teams in the National Hockey League , with all individual voters ranking their top three candidates on a 531 points system. 18 Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs. Records and distinctions  edit  Jacques Plante holds the record for winning the most Vezinas with seven, followed by Bill Durnan and Dominik Hasek , who have won six each. Hasek has won the most awards under the current criterion of voting for the best individual goalie. 1 Players for the Montreal Canadiens have won the Vezina 29 times. 1 Only four players have won both the Vezina and Hart Memorial Trophy for the same season Jacques Plante for 196162  Dominik Hasek twice, for 199697 and 199798  Jose Theodore for 200102  and Carey Price for 201415 .

Sergei Bobrovsky , twotime winner. Carey Price , onetime winner.\nAt that point, Vezina winners were recognized for being the best overall at the goalie position. Vezina Trophy for Best Goalie  History The award is named in honor of Quebecborn Joseph Georges Gonzague Vezina, a Hockey Hall of Fame goalie who played for the NHL Montreal Canadiens from 19101925. Vezina was one of the most dominating players at his position throughout his career. He was the first NHL goalie to record a shutout and the first to record an assist. He played on five Stanley Cup teams, winning twice in 1916 and 1924, and gave up the fewest number of goals in the league seven times four times in the NHA, before the Canadiens joined the NHL in 1918. Tragically, Vezina grew ill at training camp before the 192526 season, having developed tuberculosis. After a tearful goodbye to his team, he passed away in March, 1926, at age 39. The NHL introduced the Vezina Trophy for best goalie to honor the memory of this remarkable player. Vezina Trophy for Best Goalie  Trivia Seventime winner Jacques Plante Sixtime winners Bill Durnan, Dominik Hasek Fivetime winner Ken Dryden Fourtime winners Tiny Thompson, Terry Sawchuck, Michel Larocque, Martin Brodeur The first winner of the Vezina Trophy was George Hainsworth, who replaced Vezina with the Canadiens. He won this NHL goalie award in three consecutive seasons. In the 198283 season, Pete Peeters became the first and only goalie to be named best hockey goalie unanimously  he recorded eight shutouts and went undefeated for 31 games in a row that year. In 198283, there was literally no dispute about who was the best goalie in the NHL.

After meeting at a local bookstore discussing the metal band Neurosis, Pete Wentz , Joe Trohman and Patrick Stump decided to start a pop punk band, eventually bringing drummer Andrew Hurley into the fold. Their 2003 debut album Take This To Your Grave was an underground success, leading to a major label release in 2005, From Under The Cork Tree, which spawned two Top 10 singles. The band released their first chart topping album Infinity on High in 2007, followed by Folie à Deux the next year. Citing exhaustion in 2009, the band went on indefinite hiatus while pursuing other interests.

{"prompt": "on which date did ctbb distribute dividends the first time\n\nContext:\nIf the dividend is 25 or more of the stock value, special rules apply to the determination of the exdividend date. In these cases, the exdividend date will be deferred until one business day after the dividend is paid. In the above example, the exdividend date for a stock thats paying a dividend equal to 25 or more of its value, is October 4, 2017. Sometimes a company pays a dividend in the form of stock rather than cash. The stock dividend may be additional shares in the company or in a subsidiary being spun off. The procedures for stock dividends may be different from cash dividends. The exdividend date is set the first business day after the stock dividend is paid and is also after the record date. If you sell your stock before the exdividend date, you also are selling away your right to the stock dividend. Your sale includes an obligation to deliver any shares acquired as a result of the dividend to the buyer of your shares, since the seller will receive an I.O.U. or due bill from his or her broker for the additional shares. Thus, it is important to remember that the day you can sell your shares without being obligated to deliver the additional shares is not the first business day after the record date, but usually is the first business day after the stock dividend is paid. If you have questions about specific dividends, you should consult with your financial advisor.

Investors who purchase shares any day before the exdividend date will be documented as owners of shares on the record date. That means theyll be entitled to receive the dividend payment. Investors who purchase shares on or after the exdividend date wont be recognized as shareowners on the record date. Instead, the seller will still be the owner of the record and will receive the dividend payment. There are instances when the exdividend date actually appears later in the dividend payment process. This can happen when a declared dividend equals 25 or more of the value of the stock. It can also happen if the dividend is paid as stock not cash. In such circumstances, the exdividend date is set at one business day after the payable date. The SEC T2 rule for the timing of the settlement of trades calls for stock transactions to settle or be completed no more than two days after a transaction takes place. Thats why purchases made the day before the exdate, which then settle on the record date, make the buyer the owner of the record for purposes of dividend payment. Record Date vs. ExDividend Date Example Heres how the record date and exdividend date would work in the overall dividend payout process. Declaration Date ExDividend Date Record Date Payable Date February 4 February 17 February 18 March 14 Lets say that on Friday, Feb. 4, XYZ Company declares a dividend for its shareholders. The companys board then announces a record date of Friday, Feb. 18. Shareholders of record on that date will be eligible to receive the dividend. Typically, the exdividend date would fall one business day before the record date, or, on Thursday, Feb. 17. An investor who purchases shares on or before Wednesday, Feb. 16 will be a shareholder of record on Feb. 18 and will receive the dividend to be paid on March 14. An investor who purchases shares on or after Feb. 17 will not be entitled to the dividend. The Advisor Insight Brandon Opre, CFP TrustTree Financial, Fort Lauderdale, FL The legal definitions are pretty straightforward the exdividend date is one day prior to the record date. So if you want the dividend, you need to be an owner the day before the exdividend date.", "answer": "2016-11-28", "pred": "The first time CTBB distributed dividends was on February 17."}

{"prompt": "what do you mean by the secondary market?\n\nContext:\nFor a real estate lender, this refers to loan origination. Once a loan is originated on the primary market, it may be sold on the secondary market. The secondary market is where lenders and investors buy and sell existing mortgages or mortgagebacked securities. This frees up money for additional mortgage lending.

Because if you understand the history, it will help you understand what the secondary market is and why it exists.\nIn this case, the shares are not made public. Secondary Capital Markets The secondary market is where securities are traded after the company has sold its offering on the primary market. It is also referred to as the stock market. The New York Stock Exchange NYSE, London Stock Exchange, and Nasdaq are secondary markets. Small investors have a much better chance of trading securities on the secondary market since they are excluded from IPOs. Anyone can purchase securities on the secondary market as long as they are willing to pay the asking price per share.", "answer": "the secondary market, also called the aftermarket and follow on public offering, is the financial market in which previously issued financial instruments such as stock, bonds, options, and futures are bought and sold.", "pred": "The secondary market is where existing mortgages or securities are bought and sold after being originated or issued on the primary market."}

Rocky asked me recently if I had a dream place, where would it be I told him home, Barbados. I always imagined it being that way. But realistically it probably wont be, she added.
