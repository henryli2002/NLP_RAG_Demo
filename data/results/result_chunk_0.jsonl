Exchanges provide companies with the opportunity to grow and flourish in the United States and around the world. Nasdaq , the first electronic stock exchange, was founded in 1971. With a focus on technology and innovation, Nasdaq grew to become the most active exchange in the U.S. Today, its home to many major companies that have literally changed the way we live  think Google  GOOG , GOOGL , Amazon  AMZN , Netflix  NFLX , and many more.

Downtown from Nasdaqs Times Square headquarters sits the New York Stock Exchange, which was founded in 1792. Unlike Nasdaq, the NYSE is only partially electronic some business is still conducted every day by human traders on the floor. Both Nasdaq and the NYSE are publicly traded companies on their own exchanges. Every stock exchange writes its own rules for corporations that want to trade their stock there. These rules can include how long the company has existed, how many shares are held publicly, and how much net income the company reports. Because the Nasdaq is open to listing smaller, newer companies than the NYSE, most U.S. IPOs are launched there. At the same time, each exchange must follow rules set by a larger governing bodyin the United States, that would be the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC.

Angelina Jolie was a 20something up and coming actress when she met 40something Billy Bob Thornton on the set of 1999s Pushing Tin. The official story is that, because each was involved with someone else, they didnt pursue a romance there and then. But some wonder. But by 2000, they were walking down the aisle of a Las Vegas wedding chapel to tie the knot. There followed two years of one of the most outrageously bizarre marriages Hollywood had ever seen.

But two years later, they split, finalizing the divorce in 2003.

{"prompt": "how many times has lee trevino won the masters golf tournament?\n\nContext:\nOpen in 1968. Photo provided by Ray Sanchez Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Ive been asked why Lee Trevino never won the Masters tournament even though he won three of the other majors  the U.S. Open, the British Open and the PGA  twice each. One theory that was advanced is that he never felt comfortable at the Masters then. It was considered a snobbish affair. The snobbishness relented in later years and it now seems to welcome everyone. Trevino once complained they would not have let him onto the grounds at the Masters except through the kitchen. In 1972, he stored his shoes and gear in the trunk of his car instead of changing in the clubhouse. ANOTHER THEORY offered was that not winning the Masters was all in Trevinos head. Trevino skipped the Masters three times in the prime of his career. He passed on the Masters in 1970, 71 and 74, while going on to win the U.S. Open and British Open in 1971 and the PGA Championship in 1974. Trevino maintained that he didnt play in the Masters because he was convinced he couldnt play the course. He held the 36hole lead there twice over the years, and was ahead with nine holes to play one year. But that wasnt enough to convince him. When Jack Nicklaus told him that he could win this thing, Trevino scoffed. If Jack had had to play my ittybitty tee shots, Lee said, hed have quit golf and opened a pharmacy in Ohio. BUT NOW for the real reason Lee Trevino couldnt win the Masters. On a trip to El Paso in the early 2000s, he confessed to me that the real reason he couldnt win the Masters was because he couldnt hit the ball high enough to conquer the hilly course. He said he was strictly a linedriver hitter off the tee and that wouldnt work on the Masters course. Nicklaus could hit the ball high and long and made history there.

Surrounding Jason Reitman were dozens of screenwriters, storyboards, and artwork for a franchise hes known intimately his entire life. No, were not talking about Ghostbusters. Years before Reitman decided to finally follow in his fathers footsteps and direct a Ghostbusters movie, he was invited by Michael Bay to work on another blockbuster franchise  Transformers. Advertisement Reitman had a giant smile on his face as he recounted via Zoom his very brief time in the Transformers universe, eventually working on scripts specifically punching up the dialogue for Dark of the Moon and Age of Extinction. By the end of his story, he drove home the point Filmmakers are allowed to do things beyond what they are known for. Its very easy to look at a director and their work and think this is the sum total of that human being, he told Insider back in September. The truth is I love horror films. I love big box office movies. To play in that Transformers world was like, I used to play with Transformers now I get to play in Transformers. Now Reitman is taking that thinking a step further with his latest movie, Ghostbusters Afterlife, in theaters November 19, the latest sequel in the franchise that his father, Ivan Reitman, launched. In 1984, Ghostbusters became a runaway hit and made the foursome  Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson  battling evil spirits around New York City household names. Reitman, whos built a career making Oscarnominated dramas like Juno and Up in the Air, is well aware of his connection to the movie, which seems to haunt him almost like a ghost. I dont go a day in my life without seeing someone wearing a Ghostbusters Tshirt, he noted. For most of his life, the 44yearold director has chosen to ignore his fathers moviemaking legacy  vowing never to make a Ghostbusters movie. But all thats changed now.

{"prompt": "which goalie has the most career wins in the nhl who have never won the vezina trophy?\n\nContext:\n1981 to the present  edit  As of the 198182 NHL season , the Vezina Trophy has been given to the most outstanding goaltender as voted by the general managers of the NHL teams. 17 Billy Smith of the New York Islanders was the first winner of the Vezina under the current system. The William M. Jennings Trophy , given to the goaltenders who plays a minimum of 25 games for the team that allows the fewest goals, serves the function of the old Vezina. The voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by the 32 general managers of the teams in the National Hockey League , with all individual voters ranking their top three candidates on a 531 points system. 18 Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs. Records and distinctions  edit  Jacques Plante holds the record for winning the most Vezinas with seven, followed by Bill Durnan and Dominik Hasek , who have won six each. Hasek has won the most awards under the current criterion of voting for the best individual goalie. 1 Players for the Montreal Canadiens have won the Vezina 29 times. 1 Only four players have won both the Vezina and Hart Memorial Trophy for the same season Jacques Plante for 196162  Dominik Hasek twice, for 199697 and 199798  Jose Theodore for 200102  and Carey Price for 201415 .

Sergei Bobrovsky , twotime winner. Carey Price , onetime winner.\nAt that point, Vezina winners were recognized for being the best overall at the goalie position. Vezina Trophy for Best Goalie  History The award is named in honor of Quebecborn Joseph Georges Gonzague Vezina, a Hockey Hall of Fame goalie who played for the NHL Montreal Canadiens from 19101925. Vezina was one of the most dominating players at his position throughout his career. He was the first NHL goalie to record a shutout and the first to record an assist. He played on five Stanley Cup teams, winning twice in 1916 and 1924, and gave up the fewest number of goals in the league seven times four times in the NHA, before the Canadiens joined the NHL in 1918. Tragically, Vezina grew ill at training camp before the 192526 season, having developed tuberculosis. After a tearful goodbye to his team, he passed away in March, 1926, at age 39. The NHL introduced the Vezina Trophy for best goalie to honor the memory of this remarkable player. Vezina Trophy for Best Goalie  Trivia Seventime winner Jacques Plante Sixtime winners Bill Durnan, Dominik Hasek Fivetime winner Ken Dryden Fourtime winners Tiny Thompson, Terry Sawchuck, Michel Larocque, Martin Brodeur The first winner of the Vezina Trophy was George Hainsworth, who replaced Vezina with the Canadiens. He won this NHL goalie award in three consecutive seasons. In the 198283 season, Pete Peeters became the first and only goalie to be named best hockey goalie unanimously  he recorded eight shutouts and went undefeated for 31 games in a row that year. In 198283, there was literally no dispute about who was the best goalie in the NHL.

Snippets from interviews with the bands road crew and others are featured alongside philosophical quotations.

They are the record date or date of record and the exdividend date or exdate. When a company declares a dividend, it sets a record date when you must be on the companys books as a shareholder to receive the dividend. Companies also use this date to determine who is sent proxy statements, financial reports, and other information. Once the company sets the record date, the exdividend date is set based on stock exchange rules. The exdividend date for stocks is usually set one business day before the record date. If you purchase a stock on its exdividend date or after, you will not receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. If you purchase before the exdividend date, you get the dividend. Here is an example Declaration Date ExDividend Date Record Date Payable Date Friday, 982017 Friday, 9152017 Monday, 9182017 Tuesday, 1032017 On September 8, 2017, Company XYZ declares a dividend payable on October 3, 2017 to its shareholders. XYZ also announces that shareholders of record on the companys books on or before September 18, 2017 are entitled to the dividend. The stock would then go exdividend one business day before the record date. In this example, the record date falls on a Monday. Excluding weekends and holidays, the exdividend is set one business day before the record date or the opening of the marketin this case on the preceding Friday. This means anyone who bought the stock on Friday or after would not get the dividend. At the same time, those who purchase before the exdividend date on Friday will receive the dividend. With a significant dividend, the price of a stock may fall by that amount on the exdividend date.\nThe exdate is usually one business day before the record date. Investors who purchase shares any day before the exdividend date will be documented as owners of shares on the record date. That means theyll be entitled to receive the dividend payment. Investors who purchase shares on or after the exdividend date wont be recognized as shareowners on the record date. Instead, the seller will still be the owner of the record and will receive the dividend payment. There are instances when the exdividend date actually appears later in the dividend payment process. This can happen when a declared dividend equals 25 or more of the value of the stock. It can also happen if the dividend is paid as stock not cash. In such circumstances, the exdividend date is set at one business day after the payable date. The SEC T2 rule for the timing of the settlement of trades calls for stock transactions to settle or be completed no more than two days after a transaction takes place. Thats why purchases made the day before the exdate, which then settle on the record date, make the buyer the owner of the record for purposes of dividend payment. Record Date vs. ExDividend Date Example Heres how the record date and exdividend date would work in the overall dividend payout process. Declaration Date ExDividend Date Record Date Payable Date February 4 February 17 February 18 March 14 Lets say that on Friday, Feb. 4, XYZ Company declares a dividend for its shareholders. The companys board then announces a record date of Friday, Feb. 18. Shareholders of record on that date will be eligible to receive the dividend. Typically, the exdividend date would fall one business day before the record date, or, on Thursday, Feb. 17. An investor who purchases shares on or before Wednesday, Feb. 16 will be a shareholder of record on Feb. 18 and will receive the dividend to be paid on March 14. An investor who purchases shares on or after Feb. 17 will not be entitled to the dividend. The Advisor Insight Brandon Opre, CFP TrustTree Financial, Fort Lauderdale, FL The legal definitions are pretty straightforward the exdividend date is one day prior to the record date. So if you want the dividend, you need to be an owner the day before the exdividend date.", "answer": "2016-11-28", "pred": "The first time ctbb distributed dividends was on the Payable Date of Tuesday, 10/3/2017."}

She talked about wanting more kids following RZAs birth. They want a big family for sure. Rihanna loved being pregnant and fully embraced her pregnancy body, a source told Us Weekly shortly after she had her first child.

And Rihanna was planning to have them with or without a partner I feel like society makes me want to feel like, Oh, you got it wrong They diminish you as a mother if theres not a dad in your kids lives, she said. But the only thing that matters is happiness, thats the only healthy relationship between a parent and a child. Thats the only thing that can raise a child truly, is love. Rihanna changed her tone a bit in her interview with British Vogue , joking that she has to be careful with what she says with regards to the four kids comment. Listen, Im down for whatever. My wish would be I would like to have more kids, but whatever God wants for me, Im here. Now, it seems the singer is happy with her family of four. Rihannas son RZA has multiple caretakers.

Its since been confirmed that they have some help, a source told Us Weekly . As for where she was raising RZA, it was a difficult decision. Rocky asked me recently if I had a dream place, where would it be I told him home, Barbados. I always imagined it being that way. But realistically it probably wont be, she added. Diversity and versatility will be major values in Rihanna and AAPs household. I will always remind my children to never lose their imagination, even as adults, no matter what, AAP told Dazed in an interview in May 2022. I hope to raise openminded children.
