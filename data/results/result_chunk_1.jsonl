{"prompt": "what's forty's earnings per share?\n\nContext:\nTypically, an average number is used because companies may issue or buy back stock throughout the year and that makes the actual outstanding shares and true earnings per share difficult to pin down. Using an average of outstanding shares can provide an accurate picture of the earnings for the company. Key Takeaways Earnings per share is the portion of a companys income available to shareholders and allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. EPS equals the difference between net income and preferred dividends, divided by the average number of outstanding common shares. EPS is sometimes known as the bottom line of a firms worth.\nAnother type of earnings per share formula is adjusted EPS . This removes all noncore profits and losses, as well as those in minority interests. The focus of this calculation is to see only profit or loss generated from core operations on a normalized basis. Earnings Per Share Formula Example ABC Ltd has a net income of 1 million in the third quarter. The company announces dividends of 250,000. Total shares outstanding is at 11,000,000.

Has Brooks Koepka ever won the Masters The short answer is no. Close  but no green jacket for Koepka. However, with 11 birdies and an eagle through the first 36 holes, he is in a good spot at 12under. Koepka notched a win at LIV Golf Orlando coming into the Masters, an indication of the form hes in right now. He missed the cut at Augusta each of the last two years, but Koepka has always had some level of success at this particular major. In seven attempts, Koepka has finished twice inside the top ten  including one runnerup in 2019  and an 11th placed finish in 2017. It appeared that Koepka would be well on his way to the coveted green jacket in 2019, but he was doomed by a poor final round and a bad day with the putter. Tiger Woods would go on to capture his fifth Masters win that year.

Despite its common name, the koala bear is not a bear at all, and its closest living relative is the wombat . The sole member of the family Phascolarctidae, the average koala measures 24 to 33 inches long and weighs from 9 to 33 pounds. Known for their distinctive round head and fluffy greyishbrown fur, koalas have become a symbol of conservation in Australia. While they have few natural predators, the IUCN lists the species as Vulnerable due to habitat loss. Today, conservation efforts are in place that aim to stabilize and increase the number of koalas.

The company was founded in 2004 and went public via IPO on May 18, 2012 with a share price of 38. The price dropped to under 18 a share early on before rising to where it is in 2023, with a market cap of around half a trillion dollars. Facebooks IPO Failed to Meet Expectations Facebook made its longawaited filing for an initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on Feb. 1, 2012.

{"prompt": "which stock currently has a higher average volume as of feb 15 2024? microsoft or apple\n\nContext:\nMicrosoft and Apple have jostled for top spot over the years. It was inevitable that Microsoft would overtake Apple since Microsoft is growing faster and has more to benefit from the generative AI revolution, said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. Microsoft has incorporated OpenAIs technology across its suite of productivity software, a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloudcomputing business in the JulySeptember quarter. Apple, meanwhile, has been grappling with weakening demand, including for the iPhone, its biggest cash cow. Demand in China, a major market, has slumped as the countrys economy makes a slow recovery from the pandemic and a resurgent Huawei HWT.UL chips away at its market share. China could be a drag on performance over the coming years, brokerage Redburn Atlantic said in a client note on Wednesday, downgrading Apples shares to neutral. At least three of the 41 analysts covering Apple have lowered their ratings since the start of 2024. At 2.85 trillion, windows maker overtakes Apple in terms of valuation Shares of Cupertino, Californiabased Apple have fallen 3.3 in January as of the last close, compared with a 1.8 rise in Microsoft. Both stocks are expensive in terms of their share pricetoearnings PE ratio, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies. Apple is trading at a forward PE of 28, well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years, according to LSEG data. Microsoft is trading around 31 times forward earnings, above its 10year average of 24. Shares of Apple, whose market capitalization peaked at 3.081 trillion on Dec. 14, ended last year with a gain of 48. That was lower than the 57 rise posted by Microsoft. Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company a handful of times since 2018, including in 2021 when concerns about COVIDdriven supply chain shortages hit the iPhone makers stock price.

But just how many Fast and Furious movies will there be  When The Fast  the Furious came out in 2001, the movie was a surprise hit, and I, as a sophomore in high school, thought it was the coolest thing ever. But after two lackluster sequels, the franchise appeared dead in the water in 2006 before reuniting the original cast for 2009s Fast  Furious . Then, the fifth film in the franchise, Fast Five , shifted genres from street racing to heist films, making the series the box office powerhouse that it is today the most recent film, Furious 7 , is the sixth highestgrossing film of all time. But with The Fate of the Furious , the franchise again finds itself at a crossroads. The death of Paul Walker during the filming of F urious 7 means the series will be without one of its stars moving forward. The new film also represents another genre shift, as the focus changes from a heist film to something more closely resembling a spy movie. So if you look at the first four films in the franchise as a street racing tetralogy, and the last three as a heist trilogy, then it makes sense for The Fate of the Furious to kick off a new mini series within the franchise  but how many films will it last As of right now, the plan is for The Fate of the Furious to be the start of a new trilogy arc within the franchise, leaving a total of 10 Fast and the Furious movies overall. No one could have guessed the franchise would last that long back in 2001  and certainly not after 2006s flop Tokyo Drift  and yet, here we are. Series star and producer Vin Diesel announced the franchises intentions himself on Instagram in February of last year, not only confirming that two more films were on the way after number eight, but also revealing that the release dates for the ninth and tenth films were already nailed down.\nClose Alert Sign In Search Search Security Politics Gear Backchannel Business Science Culture Ideas Merch Podcasts Video Wired World Artificial Intelligence Climate Games Newsletters Magazine Events Wired Insider Jobs Coupons Kevin McFarland Culture Apr 3, 2015 1100 AM How Many Cars Have the Fast and Furious Movies Destroyed With Furious 7 hitting theater today, we crunched the numbers to see how the series transitioned from drag races to impossible halfhour runway chases.", "answer": "10 movies", "pred": "There are a total of 10 Fast and Furious movies in the franchise."}

{"prompt": "what is plato's theory of forms?\n\nContext:\nA Difficult Philosophical Concept to Grasp Platos Theory of Forms is a difficult concept to grasp because it requires one to think in abstract thought about concrete objects. No object is a perfect representation of the idea it represents, according to this theory. Each object in the real world is a mere flawed representation of the perfect Forms they represent. Because the Forms are perfect versions of their corresponding physical objects, the Forms can be considered to be the most real and purest things in existence, according to Plato.\nFor many modern thinkers, it is difficult to think of these Forms as being separate from the objects that they represent in the real world. However, there are no perfect examples of any Form that exists in the real world. Wondering about Platos Theory of Forms Look no further What Are Platonic Forms The Platonic Forms, according to Plato, are just ideas of things that actually exist. They represent what each individual thing is supposed to be like in order for it to be that specific thing. For example, the Form of human shows qualities one must have in order to be human.", "answer": "plato's theory of forms suggests that the physical world is not as real or true as \"forms\". according to this theory, forms—conventionally capitalized and also commonly translated as \"ideas\"—are the non-physical, timeless, absolute, and unchangeable essences of all things, of which objects and matter in the physical world are merely imitations.", "pred": "Plato's theory of Forms posits that physical objects are imperfect representations of perfect Forms, which are the purest and most real entities.

What is the volume of the cylinder  Socratic Geometry Science Anatomy  Physiology Astronomy Astrophysics Biology Chemistry Earth Science Environmental Science Organic Chemistry Physics Math Algebra Calculus Geometry Prealgebra Precalculus Statistics Trigonometry Humanities English Grammar U.S. History World History ... and beyond Socratic Meta Featured Answers Topics A cylinder has a height of 4 feet and a diameter of 12 inches. What is the volume of the cylinder Geometry Perimeter, Area, and Volume Perimeter and Area of NonStandard Shapes 1 Answer Noah G Aug 7, 2016 Before calculating the volume of this cylinder, we must either convert the diameter to feet or the height to inches. Ill do the latter, to avoid getting a very small number. Recall that there are 12 inches in 1 foot. Thus, we can state 12 in.1 ft. x4 ft. x  12 in. xx 4cancel ft.1cancelft. x  48 in. Hence, the cylinder has a height of 48 inches. Now, we can apply the formula for volume of a cylinder to effectuate our calculation. The formula in question is V  a_base xx h , or V  r2pi xx h . However, we know our diameter but we dont know our radius. As you probably know, the diameter is linked to the radius b the formula d  2r . Solving for r and substituting r  d2 r  122 r  6 . The radius of the cylinder measures 6 inches. V  r2pi xx h V  62pi xx 48 V  36 xx 48pi V  1728pi in2 Note that this answer is in exact value. Rounded to two decimal places, the volume is 5428.67 in2 . Practice exercises Determine the volume of a cylinder whose base has a circumference of 18pi yd. and whose height measures 27 ft. .

Nike hit a stock price of 5.11 on February 13th, 1998, which represented a decrease of 46 in only one year.

{"prompt": "can you compare the market caps of cogt and ftft and tell which one is larger?\n\nContext:\nFor example, if a company has 5 million shares outstanding and its current stock price is 20, it has a market capitalization of 100 million. You may hear companies described as largecap, midcap or smallcapor even megacap or microcap. The delineation between each group can vary, but generally, youll see them broken down like this megacap  market value of 200 billion or more largecap  market value between 10 billion and 200 billion midcap  market value between 2 billion and 10 billion smallcap  market value between 250 million and 2 billion and microcap  market value of less than 250 million. Certain stock indexes or investment funds will use this measure to group companies together by size. For example, the SP 500 is made up of megacap and largecap stocks and is weighed by market cap, so companies with a higher market cap account for relatively more of the index than companies with a comparatively smaller market cap. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 Index is a smallcap stock market index. Newer investors might mistakenly believe that stock price alone could be a good indicator of how large a company is, but whats most important in determining a companys size is the number of shares outstanding. Take Company A and Company B, for example. Both have stocks trading at 50 a share, but Company A has 5 million shares outstanding, and Company B has 5 billion shares outstanding. That means Company A has a market cap of 250 million, making it a smallcap company, whereas Company B has a market cap of 250 billion, meaning its a particularly large, largecap companyoften called a megacap company. Why Market Cap Matters For starters, market cap can give you a general idea of where a company stands in the business development process. Is it a relatively new public company, for example If so, it might have room for growth. After all, access to investor capital to expand the business is why many companies decide to go public in the first place. Market cap can also provide a rough gauge of a companys stability. Largecap companies tend to be less vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market than midcap companies, and midcap companies are generally less susceptible to volatility than smallcap companies.\nThats in part because larger companies typically have greater financial reserves and therefore often can absorb losses more easily and bounce back more quickly from a bad year. At the same time, smaller companies might have greater potential for fast growth in economic boom times than larger companies. This is why some dividend seekers will use market cap as a filter when looking for companies that pay consistent dividends . These generalizations are no guarantee that any particular largecap company will weather a downturn well or that any particular smallcap company will or wont thrive. Still, market cap can be a useful gaugeparticularly when it comes to diversifying your portfolio . When you diversify, you aim to manage your risk by spreading out your investments. You can diversify by investing among different asset classes for example, by investing in both stocks and bonds. And you can also diversify within asset classes. Investing in smallcap and largecap stocks is one example of diversifying within one asset class stocks. The Limitations of Market Cap Something important to keep in mind is that market cap is the perceived value of a company because stock price is determined by investors. It isnt necessarily the actual value of a company and all of its parts. Some of that perceived value may stem from expectations of future growth or the introduction of a product, but those expectations may not pan out, in which case the share price of the companyand thus its market capis likely to adjust accordingly. Thats why its a good idea to look at a number of metrics when considering an investment. Market cap can be one tool you use to develop a diverse portfolio, but it shouldnt be your only tool.", "answer": "cogt", "pred": "COGT has a market cap of 1.4 billion, while FTFT has a market cap of 46.8 million. Therefore, COGT has a larger market cap compared to FTFT."}

Chambers, who engineered prosthetic body parts and limbs for injured World War II veterans before transferring to Hollywood, was uniquely qualified to tackle Planet of the Apes where he designed, sculpted, tested, and manufactured the prosthetics for more than 200 ape characters on a budget of reportedly less than a million dollars. Tom Burman, who started his own 50year makeup career assisting on the film, has said Planet of the Apes was the turning point for makeup. The studios didnt realize you could make a movie around wonderful characters, and put makeup on big actors like this. It changed the telling of the stories.
