Over a third of the current NFL teams have never won a Lombardi Trophy, four of which have never even made the big game. Which NFL Teams Have Never Won A Super Bowl Below are the 12 NFL teams without a Super Bowl win Minnesota Vikings Buffalo Bills Cincinnati Bengals Carolina Panthers Atlanta Falcons Los Angeles Chargers Tennessee Titans Arizona Cardinals Cleveland Browns Detroit Lions Houston Texans Jacksonville Jaguars The Buffalo Bills Suffered Four Straight SB Losses The Bills are the team that sticks out on this list. While they have never been called Super Bowl winners , they certainly had their chances. From 1990 to 1994, the Bills represented the AFC in four straight Super Bowls. They are the only team to ever appear in four straight. The rest is history, however. Scott Norwood went wide right in the Bills first appearance, and Jim Kelly never got his elusive Super Bowl victory. Four NFL Teams Have Never Played In A Super Bowl Of the teams to never have the luxury of being called Super Bowl winners, four have the dubious distinction of never even making it the Browns, Lions, Texans, and Jaguars. In truth, the Jaguars and Texans deserve a bit of a pass as they are still two of the youngest teams in the NFL. Alongside Carolina, Jacksonville was added as an expansion team during the 1996 season. But the Panthers have reached the SB twice during their tenure, despite not winning the big game yet. The Houston area saw the return of football in 2002 after a short hiatus from the game. From 1960 to 1996, the Houston Oilers called the city home until their relocation to Nashville in 1997.

Learn about our Financial Review Board Trending Videos What Is Volume of Trade Volume of trade is the total quantity of shares or contracts traded for a specified security. It can be measured on any type of security traded during a trading day. Volume of trade or trade volume is measured on stocks, bonds, options contracts, futures contracts , and all types of commodities. Key Takeaways The volume of trade refers to the total number of shares or contracts exchanged between buyers and sellers of a security during trading hours on a given day. The volume of trade is a measure of the markets activity and liquidity during a set period of time. Higher trading volumes are considered more positive than lower trading volumes because they mean more liquidity and better order execution. Understanding Volume of Trade Volume of trade measures the total number of shares or contracts transacted for a specified security during a specified time period. It includes the total number of shares transacted between a buyer and seller during a transaction. When securities are more actively traded, their trade volume is high, and when securities are less actively traded, their trade volume is low. Volume tends to be highest near the market open and close and the start of the week and last day of the week. How Volume of Trade Works Each market exchange tracks its trading volume and provides volume data. The volumes of trade numbers are reported as often as once an hour throughout the current trading day. These hourly reported trade volumes are estimates . A trade volume reported at the end of the day is also an estimate. Final actual figures are reported the following day. Investors may also follow a securitys tick volume, or the number of changes in a contracts price, as a surrogate for trade volume since prices tend to change more frequently with a higher volume of trade. Volume tells investors about the markets activity and liquidity. Higher trade volumes for specified security mean higher liquidity , better order execution, and a more active market for connecting a buyer and seller. When investors feel hesitant about the direction of the stock market , futures trading volume tends to increase, which often causes options and futures on specified securities to trade more actively. Volume overall tends to be higher near the markets opening and closing times, and on Mondays and Fridays. It tends to be lower at lunchtime and before a holiday.", "answer": "57400", "pred": "The trading volume of HTCR on the last trading day was 1.4 times normal volume."}

In small masjidstyle mosques, the minarets are usually integrated with the masjid, while the minaret is built separately from the mosque when the dimensions of the mosque get a little larger.

{"prompt": "how many times does apple report their earnings each year?\n\nContext:\n1.68 in Q1 FY 2021. iPhone revenue is expected to rise at the slowest pace in four quarters. Companywide revenue growth is predicted to slow significantly compared to the most recent four quarters. Apple Inc.  AAPL  in the past fiscal year has posted dramatic growth in earnings, revenue, and in sales of iPhones, its flagship product. This growth came amid a global supply shortage that hurt Apples production capacity during the pandemic. But signs have emerged that the companys growth is slowing. Apple has told component suppliers that demand for its iPhone 13 line has weakened, and the company has cut its iPhone 13 production goal by as much 10 million units for this fiscal year. Investors are likely to look at how these and other recent developments have impacted Apples earnings and revenue performance when the company reports earnings after market on Jan. 27, 2022 for Q1 FY 2022. Apples Q1 coincides roughly with the calendar fourth quarter of 2021. Apples fiscal year ends in September. Analysts expect that the company will report yearoveryear YOY growth in both earnings per share  EPS  and revenue. However, they are predicted to grow at slower rates than the previous four quarters. Investors will also focus on Apples key metric of iPhone revenue. The iPhone is Apples most popular product. After torrid sales in each quarter of FY 2021, analysts expect iPhone revenue grow to drastically decelerate in Q1 FY 2022. Although Apples earnings and revenue have grown at a considerable pace throughout the past year, the companys stock has generally underperformed the broader market. Apple shares fell below the market in January 2021 and continued to lag for most of the year. The stock began a sustained rally in October 2021, closing the performance gap and eventually outperforming the SP 500 in December and into the new year. However, in January 2022 Apple shares have tumbled along with the broader market. As of Jan. 25, Apple has provided 1year trailing total returns of 12.5, just behind the SP 500s total returns of 13.0. Source TradingView. Apple Earnings History Apple is one of the rare companies to avoid consistent declines in EPS during the COVID19 pandemic.\nThe company has posted YOY EPS declines in just three of the past 15 quarters Q2 and Q3 FY 2019 and Q4 FY 2020. Otherwise, Apple EPS has consistently grown YOY, although it has ranged dramatically, from 3.8 in Q2 FY 2020 up to 118.6 in Q2 FY 2021. The three most recent quarterly periods have seen the most dramatic EPS growth in nearly four years. Analysts now predict that Q1 FY 2022 EPS growth will slow to 11.9 YOY, only a third of the growth rate in the same quarter a year earlier. Its also a fraction of the pace of growth in the most recent three reported quarters. Apples revenue growth has been more consistent. Q1 and Q2 FY 2019 are the only quarters in the past four years to see YOY declines and they were both relatively modest. Apples revenue growth has fluctuated dramatically. The company posted increases of less than 2 YOY, for example, during the six quarters between Q3 FY 2019 and Q4 FY 2020. But growth has accelerated significantly in the past four quarters, to a high of 53.6 in Q2 FY 2021. For Q1 FY 2022, analysts estimate that Apples revenue rose by 6.6, a sharp deceleration from previous quarters. Apple Key Stats Estimate for Q1 FY 2022 Q1 FY 2021 Q1 FY 2020 Earnings Per Share 1.88 1.68 1.25 Revenue B 118.7 111.4 91.8 iPhone Revenue B 68.4 65.6 56.0 Source Visible Alpha The Key Metric As mentioned, a key metric investors will focus on is Apples iPhone revenue. iPhone sales are a substantial portion of Apples revenue and historically have accounted for about half or more of the companys annual revenue. Apples coming report for fiscal Q1 FY 2022 includes the NovemberDecember holiday sales period. Apples iPhone sales have often benefited from a strong general retail industry environment. During the 2021 holiday shopping season, retail industry sales were up more than 14 YOY to a record 886.7 billion, according to the National Retail Federation.

Director Charles Ferguson, who became a filmmaker after making millions of dollars developing internet software, had lost out at the Oscars before, when his 2007 film about the Iraq war, No End in Sight, was nominated, but this time he had a happy ending. Inside Job, which premiered at the Cannes film festival in 2010, traces the connections between government and financial institutions, as well as theoretically independent academics, showing how they combined to trigger excessive profittaking and endanger the wider economy.

The respected American won his only major championship when he lifted the Claret Jug at Royal Troon and went on to achieve 28 professional wins in an impressive career. Indeed, Weiskopfs most successful decade was the 1970s, winning 16 PGA Tour titles between 1968 and 1982. At the end of 1973, he was ranked the secondbest player in the world. Born in Massillion, Ohio in 1942, Weiskopfs first win on the PGA Tour came at the Andy WilliamsSan Diego Open Invitational in 1968. His swing was much admired in the golf world as he hit the ball high, generated enormous power and had very good control as well, a rare combination. While his occasional temper earned him the nickname of The Towering Inferno, Weiskopf kept his cool at Troon in 1973 to achieve his greatest feat in the game in imperious style. Weiskopf won The Open by three strokes over runnersup Neil Coles from England and American Johnny Miller, the winner of the US Open a month earlier. Jack Nicklaus was fourth a shot further back. Notably, Weiskopf was a wiretowire winner and his fourround total of 12underpar 276 matched the thenexisting Open record set by Arnold Palmer on the very same course in 1962. To win my first major championship in the country where golf started is something you cant explain, he said in his winners speech. Its the most inspirational place Ive ever played golf and Im very proud to be your Champion. Such was his ability, Weiskopf came close to winning other majors. He was a runnerup four times in the Masters Tournament sharing that record with Nicklaus and Ben Hogan, had five topfour finishes at the US Open and four topeights at the PGA Championship. He also tied seventh in The Open in 1972 at Muirfield and in 1974 at Royal Lytham  St Annes, with further joy on British soil coming when he won the Benson  Hedges International Open in 1981 at Fulford. Weiskopf also won the Canadian Open in 1973 and 1975 and was a member of the victorious United States team in the Ryder Cup in both those years. Weiskopf joined the Senior PGA Tour in 1993 and won several senior tournaments, including one senior major, the 1995 US Senior Open, beating Nicklaus by four strokes. After winding down his tournament career, Weiskopf become a noted golf course architect as well as working in broadcasting. He has at least 40 courses to his credit in many parts of the world.

Apple  AAPL  has been beating Microsoft  MSFT  year to date appreciationwise, as well as the overall market. Not only that, the difference in its superior return on equity in comparison to Microsofts is widening AAPL Return on Equity TTM data by YCharts Id like to know why. Id also like to expand on the comparisons between the companies further, largely because I see them as the top two contenders for investors wishing to add an allocation to the tech sector with a conservative, dividendpaying bluechip. Breaking down return on equity To gain more insight into the opposing ROE trends of both companies, Ive pulled numbers from their annual reports to construct a five stage Dupont analysis. Note Im using annual figures to make the comparisons easier, but these numbers are a little outdated. Apples fiscal 2014 ended in September 2014, Microsofts ended in June 2014. This is why I used ttm to examine more current ROE trends on a rolling basis in the beginning of the article. These numbers are still useful for examining the overall trends in ROE for both companies, however. Microsoft wont report FY2015 until the end of July if history is any indication. We can see over the last 3 years that Apple has managed to generate better ROE mostly because of its ability to utilize its assets better than Microsoft, despite the latters better operating margins. Its superior ROE, along with its intention to keep more of its earnings than it pays out in dividends, also gives Apple a superior sustainable growth rate, nearly twice the rate as Microsofts. Microsofts margins are impressive, but declined yearoveryear. It should also be noted that its more dividendoriented, with shares yielding about 2.8, as opposed to Apples dividend yield of only 1.6. This makes sense, however, because lower growth usually means higher dividends. Valuations and fundamentals Apple is expected to grow over 26, Microsoft is only expected to grow 78 for the year. Growth is expected to dip for both firms in 2016, more so for Microsoft than for Apple, however. While this makes Apple look more attractive, valuations are important as well. Heres where Apple shines even more, trading at only about 14 times this years earnings and 13 times forward earnings. Microsoft is trading at over 18 times this years earnings and 16 times forward earnings. Turning to the balance sheet, both companies have fat cash piles, with much of it held overseas. This has led to increased debt issuance to cover certain things domestically instead of repatriating the cash to do it, including buybacks. This may help to explain why both companies have seen their financial leverage ratios assetsequity trend higher over the last few years. Microsoft carried a current ratio of 2.5 for FY2014, a drop from 2013s ratio of 2.7, but solid nonetheless. Apples dropped to 1.08 from a current ratio of 1.68 in 2013. This was largely due to an increase in accounts payable and the addition of a significant amount of commercial paper. Both companies appear to have solid liquidity with adequate working capital. Id now like to turn to the cash conversion cycle to see how efficient the companies are managing cash flow. AAPL Days Sales Outstanding Annual data by YCharts As can be seen, Microsoft puts more pressure on suppliers by taking longer to pay than Apple does, judging by its DPO. This surprised me, as I thought Apple would be the winner here. Apples inventory management is incredible as well, and it also seems to convert receivables much more efficiently than Microsoft. This is why Apple has a negative CCC and Microsofts stands at an acceptable 20.14 days. This likely has to do with different business models, however, as one company is more hardwareoriented and the other is more softwarebased. Turning to solvency ratios, both companies look solid as well AAPL Debt to Equity Ratio Annual data by YCharts We can see that despite the recent trend of both companies issuing more debt, it hasnt battered the overall financial health of either firm by adding too much of it to their existing capital structures. Conclusion Apple appears to be a more attractive investment than Microsoft when looking at ROE, growth prospects, efficiency, and even balance sheets, so why the discount In my opinion, it obviously has something to do with the diversification of revenues bases. While Apple has lots of irons in the fire, its still heavily reliant on iPhone sales. I think this concern is overblown personally, but I can see the logic of it one bad iPhone flop and revenues could drop off pretty significantly pretty quickly. Even with this in mind, however, I still think Apple is cheaper than it should be, especially as it seems to be firing on all cylinders. Heres where Microsoft deserves some credit as a longterm investment, however. As long as consumers, and more importantly, businesses, continue to rely on its products like Office, Azure, and Windows, I think the company has a tremendous moat around its business that will remain for many years to come. Especially as it transitions many of these services to be more cloudoriented, converting them to lucrative subscriptionbased business models. This cuts down on piracy, and the recurring nature of them makes them even stickier to business in my opinion. Will this degrade margins though Possibly, which is something to watch out for. I think Apple is a better value here, especially in the near term. Microsoft is still a great longerterm investment, and Apple will likely be as well, depending on what the future of the iPhone and the future diversification of its business mix looks like. Me personally Im going to keep collecting dividends from Microsoft, but Im also seriously considering adding Apple to my portfolio, too. It just looks too cheap not to.

Copyright  2024 collider.com Oscars 2018 Dunkirk, The Last Jedi, The Shape of Water Advance in VFX Race By Haleigh Foutch Published Dec 18, 2017 The Academy trims the visual effects finalists down to ten. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science has tightened the race to ten finalists for the Outstanding Visual Effects category in the 2018 race, including lastminute entry Star Wars The Last Jedi . Among the films making the cut are visual feasts like Blade Runner 2049 , Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets , and Guardians of the Galaxy , as well as less fantastical films like Okja and Dunkirk . War for the Planet of the Apes , which has some of the most stunning, emotional and photoreal motion capture work of all time, may seem like a shooin, but the Apes films have historically been shut out at the Oscars and though both of the last two installments were nominated, neither took home the prize. Likewise for Marvel, which has yet to win an Academy Award in any category, despite multiple nominations in the VFX race. The last superhero movie to win the effects prize was SpiderMan 2 in 2005. Warner Bros. and Alcon Entertainment In the years since, the award has trended toward best picture nominees like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , Hugo , and Gravity . However, the last two winners have bucked that trend. Ex Machina took home the prize in 2016 and The Jungle Book won earlier this year, so perhaps the 2018 prize will offer up another surprise.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences first recognized the technical contributions of special effects to movies at its inaugural dinner in 1928, presenting a plaque for Best Engineering Effects to the first Best Picture Oscar winner, the World War I flying drama Wings . Producer David O. Selznick , then production head at RKO Studios, petitioned the Academy Board of Governors to recognize the work of animator Willis OBrien for his groundbreaking work on 1933s King Kong 1933 . But it was not until 1938 when a film was actually recognized for its effects work, when a Special Achievement Award for Special Effects was given to the Paramount film Spawn of the North . The following year, Best Special Effects became a recognized category, although on occasion the Academy has chosen to honor a single film outright rather than nominate two or more films. From 1939 to 1963, it was an award for a films visual effects as well as audio effects, so usually it was given to two persons, although some years only one or the other type of effect was recognised. In 1964, it was given only for visual effects, and the following year the name of the category was changed to Best Special Visual Effects .
