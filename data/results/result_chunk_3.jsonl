{"prompt": "what movie did captain america use the glove to stop thanos?\n\nContext:\nIron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, Thor, Captain Marvel, Rocket Racoon and other superheroes came together to kill the mighty villain. The last two Infinity saga films  Avengers Infinity War and Avengers Endgame were full of emotions and drama. In Avengers Infinity War , we saw Thanos coming facetoface with Iron Man, Captain America, Black Panther and others. In the battle scene of Wakanda, Josh Brolins Thanos came facetoface with Chris Evans Captain America for the first time. When Cap tries to stop Mad Titan from attacking Vision, he holds his hand that has infinity gauntlet. When Cap holds the villains hand, Joshs character gives him a weird look. A fan asked this question on Quora and another fan shared an interesting theory on the same. A fan questioned, Why did Thanos make that face when Captain America was holding his hand. A person named Jusis Gren answered with an exciting theory. A para from his theory reads, Maybe Thanos really was struggling slightly to resist Caps attack. As stated in the movie, Thanos can only activate the Infinity Gauntlets power when he closes his fist. Its a possibility that Steve Rogers was trying to prevent him from closing his fist to use the power of the Gauntlet by grabbing his hand, and that his expression really was that of struggle.

In the end, Iron Man managed to finish the Mad Titan and his army by snapping his fingers.

For the way the accident occurred, or the fact that the dam was already famous, due to its technical characteristics, even before the tragedy occurred. For all these reasons, the Vajont disaster always raises many new points. Building the Vajont Dam In the 50s, Italy was a quickly developing country in need of electricity. This is when the Vajont Dam project designed by the engineer Carlo Semenza was approved. It would create an artificial reservoir , in the gorge created by the Vajont torrent, in the Province of Pordenone, in the little village of Erto. Works began in 1957 and were completed in 1960  At the time, it was the worlds tallest dam. The barrier had an overall height of 261.5 metres. To this day, it still is the worlds 7 th tallest dam. Its height was not the only thing that made it very popular during the first years of the 60s, but also its structure. This curved doublearched dam was built to resist the force created by the water. The reservoir created behind the dams barrier reached 168.715 million cubic metres of water. Through very long pipings, part of the waters of the Piave, Maè and Boite rivers were channeled into that large artificial lake. A system of small hydropower stations was created, which reached the Vajont River.", "answer": "117", "pred": "Vajont Dam is 116.5 meters taller than the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam."}

{"prompt": "which player has the most career doubles in mlb history among players who have never won a gold glove award?\n\nContext:\nHis 16 Gold Glove Awards at the position are the most of any position player in baseball history. If you were an AL third baseman from 196075, and your name wasnt Brooks Robinson, you did not win the Gold Glove Award for the hot corner. Robinson may have shined brightest during the 1970 World Series against the Reds, when he made great play after great play and was named MVP.\nHeres a look at the player who won the most Gold Glove Awards at each position, along with the active leader at that position Pitcher Greg Maddux 18 Maddux was so dominant on the mound that its sometimes easy to forget that the man won the most Gold Glove Awards of any player at any position in baseball history. The Hall of Fame righthanders first Gold Glove Award came in 1990, and that began a run of 13 straight years in which he was the National Leagues Gold Glove Award winner for pitchers. If it wasnt enough that Maddux won four straight NL Cy Young Awards from 199295, you almost had no chance as an NL pitcher even when it came to a Gold Glove trophy if Maddux was still pitching. Active Zack Greinke 6 Catcher Ivan Rodriguez 13 From Day 1, you could see Rodriguez was going to be special on the baseball field, particularly behind the plate. Pudge made his Major League debut for the Rangers on June 20, 1991, against the White Sox and another Hall of Fame Pudge  Carlton Fisk. Rodriguez threw out two runners in his first career game, nailing Joey Cora in the fifth inning and Warren Newson in the eighth. Rodriguez only played in 88 games that rookie season, but won his first Gold Glove Award the following year. That began a streak of 10 consecutive Gold Glove Awards with the Rangers. His 10th, which came in 2001, tied Johnny Bench for most alltime by a catcher. He broke Benchs record while with the Tigers in 2004, and finished with 13 in his illustrious career. Active Salvador Perez 5 First base Keith Hernandez 11 He was a fivetime AllStar, a twotime World Series champion and won the 1979 NL CoMost Valuable Player Award. But Hernandez is perhaps most known for his smooth glove at first base, winning all 11 of his Gold Glove Awards in succession from 197888. With his excellence both at the plate and in the field, Hernandez garnered MVP votes in eight of his 17 seasons, including a runnerup finish in 1984 and a fourthplace finish in 86.", "answer": "tris speaker has the most career doubles in mlb history among players who have never won a gold glove award, with 792 doubles.", "pred": "The player with the most career doubles in MLB history among players who have never won a Gold Glove Award is Rafael Palmeiro."}

{"prompt": "which company has a higher dividend yield, coca-cola or procter & gamble?\n\nContext:\nIn fact, PG and Coke are a step higher on the ladder, as both belong to the Dividend Kings club  hiking their payouts annually for at least 50 consecutive years. CocaCola vs. Procter  Gamble Dividend, data by YCharts . If youre considering investing in either of these companies today, its likely because you are looking for stable longterm dividend growth. So which company will be the better dividend stock Image source Getty Images. Procter  Gamble focuses on core brands Dividend investors often take note of a companys payout ratio  the percentage of earnings paid out as dividends. Procter  Gambles dividend at first glance looks entirely unsustainable with a GAAP payout ratio exceeding 200 in fiscal 2019. But this metric is currently skewed because of writedowns in its Gillette shaving business. Mens shaving habits are changing, and Gillette doesnt do the business that it used to. Weak results from this segment led Procter  Gamble to write off 8.3 billion in goodwill in 2019. When a company writes off goodwill , it shows up on the income statement, even though no money trades hands. In fiscal 2019, Procter  Gamble paid out 7.5 billion in dividends 2.90 per share, when it only had 1.43 in earnings per share on a GAAP basis. But the company said it had core EPS of 4.52, which accounts for the 8.3 billion goodwill writeoff, among other items. When looking at core EPS, the payout ratio for 2019 was 64  much more sustainable than 203 Having addressed Procter  Gambles payout ratio, we turn to revenue growth, as its correlated to future dividend increases. In recent years, the company divested certain parts of the business that werent considered core, including 41 beauty brands sold to Coty in an 11.4 billion deal in fiscal 2017. These divestitures explain why Procter  Gambles revenue has fallen from 70.7 billion in fiscal 2015 to 67.7 billion last year. By divesting some noncore assets, Procter  Gamble has been able to increase focus on its core product categories, and the strategy appears to be working.\nThe better buy today As weve seen, Procter  Gamble has a stable dividend that should continue increasing. It raised its dividend by 4 last year, which is about what investors should expect going forward. Its current yield is just over 2. Turning to CocaCola, its dividend payout is a little high. But considering its free cash flow growth, there doesnt seem to be any real danger that CocaCola will cut its dividend. Last year, CocaCola increased its dividend by 2.5. That level of growth seems to be within reach going forward.", "answer": "as of the current financial data, procter & gamble has a higher dividend yield than coca-cola, with a dividend yield of 2.81% compared to coca-cola's 2.58%.", "pred": "Procter & Gamble has a higher dividend yield compared to Coca-Cola."}

{"prompt": "this week, what was the highest daily high stock price that imppp reached?\n\nContext:\nLearn about our Financial Review Board Trending Videos What is the HighLow Index The highlow index compares stocks that are reaching their 52week highs with stocks that are hitting their 52week lows. The highlow index is used by investors and traders to confirm the prevailing market trend of a broad market index , such as the Standard and Poors 500 index SP 500. Understanding the HighLow Index The highlow index is simply a 10day moving average of the record high percent indicator, which divides new highs by new highs plus new lows. The record high percent indicator is calculated as follows  Record High Percent  New Highs New Highs  New Lows  1 0 0 beginaligned textRecord High Percent  frac textNew Highs  textNew Highs  textNew Lows  times 100 endaligned Record High Percent  New Highs  New Lows New Highs   1 0 0   Investors consider the highlow index to be bullish if it is positive and rising, and bearish if it is negative and falling. Since the index can be volatile on a daytoday basis, market technicians generally apply a moving average on the data to smooth out the daily swings. This helps generate more reliable signals. Interpreting the HighLow Index A highlow index above 50 means more stocks are reaching 52week highs than reaching 52 lows. Conversely, a reading below 50 shows that more stocks are making 52week lows compared to stocks making 52week highs. Therefore, investors and traders are generally bullish when the index rises above 50 and bearish when it declines below 50. Typically, readings above 70 indicate that the market is trending higher , while a reading below 30 suggests that the market is in a downtrend. Investors should also be aware that If the market is trending strongly, the highlow index can give extreme readings for a prolonged period. Trading with the HighLow Index Many traders add a 20day moving average to the highlow index and use it as a signal line to enter a trade. The index generates a buy signal when it crosses above its moving average, and a sell signal when it crosses below its moving average. Traders should filter the signals generated by the highlow index with other technical indicators.\nTraders should filter the signals generated by the highlow index with other technical indicators. For example, a trader might require the relative strength index RSI to be above zero when the index crosses above its 20day moving average to confirm upward momentum. The highlow index can also be used to form a bullish or bearish bias. For instance, if the indicator is above 50, a trader may decide to trade on the long side of the market only.", "answer": "$22.24", "pred": "I'm sorry, but based on the provided context information, there is no specific mention of the stock symbol \"imppp\" or its highest daily high stock price for this week."}

{"prompt": "which five dow jones companies have been able to consistently report a profit margin of 60% or higher without having a significant amount of market share or pricing power?\n\nContext:\nBut that doesnt mean your ideal profit margin will align with this number. As a rule of thumb, 5 is a low margin, 10 is a healthy margin, and 20 is a high margin. But a onesizefitsall approach isnt the best way to set goals for your business profitability. First, some companies are inherently highmargin or lowmargin ventures. For instance, grocery stores and retailers are lowmargin. They have high expenses, as they need to purchase inventory, employ corporate employees and labor workers, facilitate shipping and distribution, and rent bigger facilities as their sales grow.\nCorrect analysis also depends on a consideration of the companys industry and its position in the business cycle . Margin ratios highlight companies that are worth further examination. Knowing that a company has a gross margin of 25 or a net profit margin of 5 tells us very little. As with any ratio used on its own, margins tell us a lot, but not the whole story, about a companys prospects.

The versatile protein is easy to cook, goes with just about any side and is healthy too. But you may wonder how it stands up in the protein department compared to other meats such as lamb. Well, it turns out chicken wins in the protein department too. Comparing the Protein Gram for gram, the difference in protein content between chicken and lamb isnt that great. A 3ounce portion of roasted chicken breast has 27 grams of protein, while the same serving of lamb sirloin has 24 grams.

As previously mentioned, lamb is higher in both calories and fat than chicken, which is important when youre trying to lose weight. Lamb is also higher in saturated fat, 3 grams versus 1 gram. High intakes of saturated fat may increase blood cholesterol levels and your risk of heart disease.

Learn about our editorial policies Trending Videos What Is the Difference Between ExDividend Date and Date of Record Are you mystified by the workings of dividends and dividend distributions Chances are its not the concept of dividends that confuses you. The exdividend date and date of record are the tricky factors. Briefly, in order to be eligible for payment of stock dividends, you must buy the stock or already own it at least two days before the date of record and still own the shares at the close of trading one business day before the exdate. Thats one day before the exdividend date. Some investment terms are tossed around more than a Frisbee on a hot summer day, so first lets fill in some of the basics of stock dividends. Key Takeaways The trading date on or after which a new buyer of a stock is not yet owed the dividend is known as the exdividend date. The company identifies all shareholders of the company on what is called the date of record. To be eligible for the dividend, you must buy the stock at least two business days before the date of record and own it by the close one business day before the exdate. There are actually four major dates in the process of a dividend distribution The declaration date is the day on which the board of directors announces the dividend. The exdate or exdividend date is the trading date on and after which the dividend is not owed to a new buyer of the stock. The exdate is one business day before the date of record. The date of record is the day on which the company checks its records to identify shareholders of the company. An investor must be listed on that date to be eligible for a dividend payout. The date of payment is the day the company mails out the dividend to all holders of record. This may be a week or more after the date of record. Why Issue a Dividend The decision to distribute a dividend is made by a companys board of directors.\nWhen the board of directors declares the dividend, it also announces whats called the record date. The record date is the date on which you must be a shareholder in order to receive a stocks dividend. To make sure shareholders get the dividends theyre entitled to, the exchange that the stock trades on sets a cutoff prior to the record date called the exdividend date. If you want to receive a stocks dividend, you have to buy shares before not onthe exdividend date. The exdividend date is usually one business day before the record date.", "answer": "none of the days", "pred": "The first dividend distribution date for CPBI is not specified in the provided context information."}

We love our homes and that includes our respective coastlines and home surf breaks. But from an objective perspective lets look at which coast of the US, the East or West, is better for surfing. When you consider swell windows, wave size, and surf break types its easy to say that the West coast has better surf than the East Coast. However, the East Coast has its own surfing merits which include smaller crowds and warmer water in the summer. Lets examine what makes for the best surfing conditions on the East Coast and the West Coast of the US and answer once and for all until the next time this conversation comes up, Is Surfing Better On The West Or East Coast Table of Contents Toggle Is Surfing Better On The West Coast Or The East Coast Swell Windows Seasonality of Surfing Conditions Continental Shelf  Continental Slope Prevailing Winds The Pacific vs The Atlantic Oceans Surfing Beach Breaks vs Point Breaks Crowded Lineups Water Temperature  Neoprene Which Coast Gets Bigger Waves The West Or The East Coast Which Coast Has Better Quality Waves Conclusion Is Surfing Better On The West Coast Or The East Coast Lets take a look at the factors at a high level that determine which coast has the better surf. West Coast East Coast Swell Window The easy winner. The easy loser. Seasonality Summer, winter  fall are great. Spring, well, not so much. Winter is cold and good. Summer is hot and flat. Fall is hurricane season. Beach Breaks  Point Breaks Has both. Beach breaks and shifting sands all day long. Crowds Dont even start. Manageable, especially in the winter. Water Temperature From very cold to sometimes the average joe will trunk it.\nWinner The West Coast. Surfing Beach Breaks vs Point Breaks Beach breaks are made of sand and shift around with tides, storms, and currents. The waves that break at these surf spots can also change quite a bit due to the shifting sand. This is life on the East Coast. Point breaks are created by a solid bottom, be it rock or reef. They are more predictable surfwise than beach breaks because the bottom doesnt change all that much. The West Coast has both beach breaks and point breaks. Winner for better surf and variety of waves West Coast. Crowded Lineups This is where the East Coast shines. The fewer waves on the East Coast and the harsher temperatures result in fewer surfers. You can easily find a peak to surf for you and your buddies just about any time of year. The West Coast on the other hand has surf breaks that typically have 100 of your closest friends every day of the week on them. Winner for less surf crowds East Coast. Water Temperature  Neoprene The East Coast can be very cold in the Winter and requires a thick wetsuit but can also feel like a bathtub in the Summer. You can frequently surf in just board shorts up through early Fall. The West Coast has a small window in the Summer that allows for wearing board shorts comfortably, but generally, you are wearing a full wetsuit for most of the year. With both coasts, the further north you go the more neoprene you need to wear. Winner With the right gear, you can surf just about any temperature on either coast just fine. Which Coast Gets Bigger Waves The West Or The East Coast The reason you never hear the phrase Mavericks of the East is because the East Coast doesnt have one. The West Coast has Mavericks and Ocean Beach in San Francisco . There are also big wave spots further up the West Coast and some in Southern California. The East Coast doesnt have big wave spots.

Lauren Solberg Mar 29, 2023 Share The gusher of profits that energy companies enjoyed from surging oil and gas prices turned into a bonanza for dividend investors in 2022. While 2023 isnt likely to repeat that windfall for investors, dividend growth among energy stocks is still on an upward trend. For energy stocks that pay dividends, the average dollar amount paid to investors grew by 390 in 2022, led by oil and gas exploration and production companies such as Diamondback Energy FANG and Pioneer Natural Resources PXD . For the rest of the U.S. market, dividend amounts increased by just 29 on average in 2022. Commodity prices were the key driver of the surge in energy stock dividends Oil and natural gas price levels both hit multiyear highs in 2022. In addition, theres been a longerstanding trend among energy companiesmainly the oil and gas EP industryof slowing down their investments into production growth in favor of returning cash to shareholders. Energy companies were flush with cash, says David Meats, director of equity research for energy and utilities at Morningstar. That gave them the ability to use that cash in several shareholderfriendly initiatives. For many energy stocks that pay dividends, this profit boom has translated into a big increase in traditional dividends. Theres also been wider adoption of what are known as variable dividends, a strategy that Morningstar analysts see as often the most attractive option for investors. What Drove the Outsize Growth of Energy Dividends in 2022 The exceptional dividend growth for energy companies in 2022 marked a continuation and strengthening of a longerterm trend. Since 2018, energystock dividends have grown by 401. Meanwhile, dividends in the rest of the U.S. market have grown by 86. As clean energy investing grows amid increasing concerns about climate change, energy companies face the prospects of a longterm decline in demand for oil and gas. That has translated into a significant change in how companies use the revenue that they generate. These companies no longer want to invest as much in their own operations, Meats says. Theyre adopting corporate strategies of limited production growth. Returning the extra cash to shareholders is the best option, according to Meats. But surging oil prices were what fueled energy companies ability to make these higher dividend payouts over the past year. Commodity prices have been the primary driver of the strong growth we saw for energy dividends in 2022, Meats says. Because oil prices were much stronger in 2022 than they were in 2021, revenues were a lot higher for energy companies, he adds. Oil and natural gas prices both hit multiyear highs in 2022 Natural gas prices reached their highest levels since 2008 and crudeoil prices rose to levels not seen in a decade, reaching 106 per barrel in March. That in turn enabled the companies in the Morningstar US Energy Sector Index to generate profits of roughly 254 billion in 2022, up from 77.5 billion in 2021. At the same time, the Morningstar US Energy Sector Index was far and away the best performer of any U.S. sector index in 2022, gaining 62.5 for its best year in the 24year history of the index. Dividend Growth for Energy Stocks Varies by Industry At the industry level, the vast majority of the energy sectors dividendsin terms of both percentage growth and actual dollar amountscome from oil and gas EP companies. This group, which includes companies that primarily focus on finding and extracting new oil reserves, increased its dividend payouts by 243.8 in 2022 alone. Since 2018, dividends in the industry have grown by nearly 900. Over the past four years, 18 oil and gas EP companies 54.5 of all the EP companies in the Morningstar US Market Index introduced new dividends. In 2022 alone, five more oil and gas EP companies introduced new dividends. Oil and gas refining and marketing companies, which process and sell petroleum products, have also seen substantial growth in dividend payouts, which increased by 63.9 in 2022. Meanwhile, the oil and gas equipment and services industrya collection of companies that provide tools and solutions for drilling and land surveyingincreased its dividends by more than 50 in 2022. In contrast, outside of the energy sector, dividendpaying companies grew their dividends by 29.3 on average over the course of 2022. The Most Durable EnergyDividend Strategies While the boom was industrywide, there are differences among individual energy companies in terms of how to pass their windfalls on to shareholders. There are traditional fixed dividends, where companies set the payouts in a place and strive to maintain or increase the dividends and avoid lowering them. Meats says investors and companies benefit from variable dividends. They allow companies to pay out more cash to shareholders when oil prices rise but lower the payout when times get tough, which avoids stressing the companies balance sheets. Commodity prices are volatile, Meats says, variable dividends are a way to signal to the market that in times when there is a lot of excess cash, an energy company will return it to shareholdersand in times when cash is tight, they can be more conservative. In addition to Pioneer Natural Resources, Devon Energy DVN also offers variable dividends to its shareholders. In addition, some energy companies are customizing the variable dividend strategy to include stock buybacks when the time is right. These management teams are recognizing that there are good times to buy stock and good times to make payments in cash, Meats says. Theyre always giving back a certain percentage of their free cash flow, but its through a hybrid approach focusing on buybacks when their stocks are cheap and making incremental cash payments at other times. Meats says that this combined approach is Morningstar equity analysts preferred strategy. Currently, EOG Resources EOG and Diamondback Energy both offer this approach. The Future for Growing Energy Dividends Is Still Intact Though 2022 was an outsize year for energy stock dividends, the longerterm trend of growth is likely still intact for the future. Energy companies are aiming to return a large portion of their free cash to shareholders, and shareholders are expecting that, says Meats. The companies will continue to follow the strategy of growing their dividends, but the dollar amount that actually gets returned over any given year is dependent on the profitability of the companies that yearin large part, that depends on commodity prices. In years such as 2022, when commodity prices spiked, shareholder returns will be especially strong. Other years wont be quite as strong. In 2023, youll see more moderate returns to shareholders, Meats says. And in any case, shareholder returns are still going to be significantly more lucrative than they were in 2016, when the focus for these companies was primarily on drilling new wells. 4 Energy Stocks With FastGrowing Dividends Below are four U.S.based oil and gas companies within the EP industry that have been growing their dividends. All four offer one of the variabledividend strategies that Meats and his team look for. These energy companies have also earned Morningstar Economic Moat Ratings of narrow, meaning they have competitive advantages strong enough to fend off competition and earn strong returns on capital for up to 10 years into the future Diamondback Energy Pioneer Natural Resources Devon Energy EOG Resources For now, Meats notes, Morningstar equity analysts see these stocks as roughly in line with their fair value estimates all of them carry a Morningstar rating of 3 stars . But from a dividend standpoint, theyve got strong practices with variable dividends that they can sustain through all the ups and downs of the market. Diamondback Energy Industry Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Economic Moat Narrow Stock Price 125.53 Morningstar Fair Value Estimate 126 Diamondback Energy was a modestsize oil and gas producer when it went public in 2012, but it has rapidly become one of the largest Permianfocused oil firms through a combination of organic growth and corporate acquisitions, most recently Firebird Energy and Lario Permian in 2022. The firm consistently ranks among the lowestcost independent producers in the entire industry, supporting a maintainable margin advantage. Because of its enviable Permian Basin acreage, Diamondback Energy is the lowestcost producer in the upstream oil and gas segment. As such, the company is better positioned to cope with weak oil prices than most peers, and at our midcycle forecastcurrently 55barrel West Texas Intermediateit can really thrive. Accordingly, we award a narrow moat rating. David Meats Pioneer Natural Resources Industry Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Economic Moat Narrow Stock Price 186.49 Morningstar Fair Value Estimate 205 Pioneer Natural Resources is one of the largest Permian Basin oil and gas producers overall, and is the largest pure play. It has about 800,000 net acres in the play, all of which is located on the Midland Basin side where it believes it can get the best returns.\nThe energy sector companies on this list had strong dividends yields of greater than 3.7 percent as of that date, as well as debttoequity ratios total equity divided by total liabilities of 0.61 and lower.
